            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Three whereof were Gentiles, <hi>Hector</hi> Son of <hi>Priamus</hi> King of <hi>Troy, Alexander</hi> the Great King of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi> and Conqueror of the World, and <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> the firſt Emperor of <hi>Rome.</hi> Three were Jews, <hi>Joſhua</hi> Captain General and Leader of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> into the Land of <hi>Canaan, David</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Judas Maccabeus</hi> a Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Jewiſh Champion againſt the Tyranny of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus.</hi> And the laſt three were Chriſtians, <hi>Arthur</hi> the famous King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44689:7"/>with his own Eyes, the total deſolation of the City of <hi>Troy,</hi> which had laſted only three hundred years, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> a faithful Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian hath related.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Hecuba</hi> was with Child of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſhe dreamed ſhe was bringing into the World a Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand, that ſhould kindle the flames of War in that Countrey, and cauſe a general Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therein. It was the cuſtom of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, when any ſtrange accident happen'd to conſult the Oracles, and enquire from them what they ought to do; When <hi>Priamus</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore underſtood his Wives Dream, he ſent to take advice with the Oracle, who informed him that this Child would be the cauſe of the Ruin of his Countrey: To prevent this, as ſoon as he was born, the King delivered him into the hands of a Souldier named <hi>Archelaus,</hi> that he might caſt him into the woods to be devoured of the Wilde Beaſts, and thereby avoid the miſchief which threatned his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; But the Mother ſeeing the Child ſo beautiful, and well ſhaped, was moved with compaſſion &amp; ſent him to Mount <hi>Ida</hi> to the Kings Shepherd, where he was brought up as his Son, this mean education did not take from him the generous qualities and inclinations which he had received from his illuſtrious birth, for on every occaſion, he made appear to all the World a great Courage, Prudence, and Juſtice, and all other virtues worthy of a Prince, ſo that he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44689:7"/>proved as Valiant as he was handſome; Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the Poets feigned, <hi>Juno, Pallas,</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> agreed to chuſe him ſole Arbitrator and Judge of their Concerns in a difference between them, which was this.</p>
            <p>At the Marriage of <hi>Peleus</hi> and <hi>Thetis,</hi> whilſt theſe Goddeſſes were merry at the Feaſt, the Goddeſs of <hi>Diſcord,</hi> caſt into the middle of the Company a Golden Apple with this Inſcription; <hi>For the Faireſt and moſt Beautiful.</hi> Each of theſe Ladies claimed it as their own, and becauſe they could not agree, they reſolved to leave it to the judgment of <hi>Paris,</hi> who was corrupted with the Charms and Promiſes of <hi>Venus;</hi> For ſhe had ingaged to procure him the handſomeſt Lady in the World, whereupon he deſpiſed the Riches of <hi>Juno,</hi> and the Wiſdom of <hi>Pallas,</hi> and pronounced his ſentence in favour of <hi>Venus,</hi> whereby he provoked the Wrath of theſe God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes againſt himſelf and all his Nation. This is the Fable.</p>
            <p>After in a Publick Aſſembly he declared who he was; for the Nobles and Gentry of the Countrey being met near the City to ſee the ſport of Wraſtling, when every one ſtrove to expreſs his Strength and Courage, he likewiſe went forth, and threw to the ground many who undertook to ingage with him; <hi>Hector</hi> the Son of <hi>Priamus</hi> among the reſt did try his ſtrength, and was alſo overcome; But this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace ſo inraged him againſt <hi>Paris,</hi> that he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44689:8"/>reſolv'd to kill him, eſteeming him no better than a Countrey Clown. In his Anger he had taken away his Life had not <hi>Paris</hi> to prevent it, ſhewn him certain ſmall Jewels which Queen <hi>Hecuba</hi> his Mother had delivered to the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd his Tutor, and thereby declared himſelf to be his Brother. King <hi>Priamus</hi> who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready admired his Addreſs and Courage in the Combats, was raviſhed with joy to underſtand the ſtrange preſervation of ſuch an Excellent Son; He therefore imbraced him, brought him to his Pallace, and gave him a Train of Attendants ſuitable to his Quality, having forgot the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle foretold he was to be ruin of his Kingdom and Country. He was at firſt renowned for his Juſtice and Civil behaviour, but vice overcame his Generous Diſpoſition, and the Pleaſures of the Court and ſudden change of his condition altered his Temper and Carriage, ſo that he had two natural Sons by <hi>Oenone, Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Ideus</hi> who were as obſcure as their Father was Famous.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Priamus</hi> thinking himſelf now ſtrong enough to encounter his old Enemies the <hi>Graeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> aſſembled his Nobility to Court, to whom he ſpake to this purpoſe, <hi>My Lords, You cannot forget the cruel injuries we have undeſervedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the</hi> Greeks, <hi>who lately invaded our Countrey, and barbarouſly murdered your Parents and Friends as well as mine; Having likewiſe carried away Captive</hi> Heſione <hi>my moſt Fair and Beloved Siſter, whom they ſtill retain among them
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44689:8"/>as a common Strumpet; You muſt needs remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how they battered down this Famous City, overthrowing and ruining the Walls, Houſes, and Pallaces thereof even to the very ground, and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed us of all our Riches and Wealth wherewith</hi> Troy <hi>did then abound. I therefore think it very juſt and reaſonable that, by the aſſiſtance of the Gods who reſiſt the Proud and Inſolent, we ought to join together, and endeavonr to take venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them for thoſe many wrongs we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ſince our City is now ſo well peopled with valiant Soldiers, and that we have Arms and Riches enough to furniſh a compleat Army. You know likewiſe we have made Alliances with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers great Princes our Neighbours, who no doubt will aſſiſt us if we ſhould have occaſion for their help. So that my opinion is, we ought now to ſeek Redreſs for all our wrongs; But ſince the fortune of War is uncertain, and none call tell the Event thereof; and though the diſhonour of my Noble Siſter be a very great Affront to me, yet before I begin the War, I will ſend ſome Prudent Perſon fairly to demand the Reſtitution of</hi> Heſione, <hi>which if granted, I will be content to remit all their other Affronts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole Council approved of this his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and <hi>Anthenor</hi> one of his Princes was inſtantly diſpatcht to <hi>Salamine</hi> to King <hi>Telamon,</hi> and being admitted into his preſence he thus Addreſſed him; <hi>Sir,</hi> Priamus <hi>King of</hi> Troy <hi>hath ſent me to your Highneſs to deſire you would pleaſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44689:9"/>to reſtore him his Siſter</hi> Heſione, <hi>whom contrary to the Laws of Honour you detain as your Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine, it being no way proper to your glory thus to abuſe the Daughter and Siſter of a King, who iſſues from a more Noble Family than your ſelf. Yet if you pleaſe to ſend her back, my Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is willing to paſs by all other Indignities and Damages, which he hath received from you or yours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>Telamon</hi> upon hearing this Meſſage fell into an extreme Paſſion, and fiercely replyed, <hi>Friend, whatever you are, I cannot but much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at the weakneſs of</hi> Priamus, <hi>with whom I have no Correſpondence, nor Amity, and whom I have not the leaſt cauſe to fear, nor grant his requeſt. Thy King ought to remember that I and others my Confederates came into his Country to revenge an injury which his Father</hi> Laomedon <hi>offered to ſome of our Allies, and becauſe I was the firſt who entered the City of</hi> Troy <hi>with great danger of my Life and Effuſion of my Blood,</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſione <hi>of whom thou ſpeakeſt, was beſtowed upon me as the recompence of my Victory to uſe her at my pleaſure, and ſince ſhe is ſo Noble and Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Lady, I am very unwilling to be deprived of what is ſo delightful to me, and whom I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with ſo much pains and danger, go there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and tell</hi> Priamus <hi>that he is never like to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her but with the point of his Sword; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I think that thou art a very diſcreet Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to undertake ſuch a Voyage with ſo great peril
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44689:9"/>of thy Life, and to bring ſuch an Errand into a Countrey where thou and thy Countreymen are mortally hated, I command thee therefore to go hence with all ſpeed as thou hopeſt to eſcape a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and cruel death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anthenor</hi> inſtantly took Shipping, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame Meſſage to King <hi>Peleus,</hi> then to King <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> and laſtly to Duke <hi>Neſtor,</hi> all of them <hi>Graecian</hi> Princes, who all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>Priamus</hi> with the utmoſt contempt and ſcorn, eſpecially <hi>Neſtor,</hi> who all inraged, ſaid, <hi>Thou vile wretch were it not for my Nobility I would cauſe thy Tongue to be pluckt out of thy mouth for preſuming to utter ſuch things before me, and in deſpight of thy King would ſee thee torn piecemeal by Wild-Horſes; Anthenor</hi> doubting he might be as good as his word, returned im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to Sea, and ſailed toward <hi>Troy,</hi> where at length after many dangers he arrived in ſafety. And then in the Company of ſeveral Noblemen he preſented himſelf before King <hi>Priamus,</hi> all the Barons of the Realm, and all the Kings Sons being preſent to hear what Tydings he brought; To whom <hi>Anthenor</hi> gave a full Account of his Embaſſy, and of all that happened to him du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Voyage. At the recital whereof, <hi>Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> was very much diſturbed, and by their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probious Speeches he perceived that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to recover his Siſter without bringing on himſelf the utmoſt force and fury of the <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians.</hi>

            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:44689:10"/>
            <p>Soon after he again aſſembled his Nobility to his Palace of <hi>Ilium,</hi> to whom he thus ſpake, <hi>My Lords, you may remember that by your advice I ſent</hi> Anthenor <hi>into</hi> Greece, <hi>to demand the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of my Siſter by all fair means poſſible, you likewiſe are ſenſible what injurious anſwers they gave to my propoſals, and how little they value the wrongs we have received, inſomuch that they threaten us with new miſchiefs, which Heaven forbid ſhould ever fall upon us; But ſince we have a ſtrong and well fortified City, and ſeveral conſiderable Princes firmly confederate with us, in my opinion we are in a Capacity to revenge theſe reiterated damages; Therefore if you think fit, we will ſend our Forces privately into their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, where finding them utterly unprovided of defence, we ſhall be able in ſome meaſure to right our ſelves upon them; Neither ought you to be diſcouraged becauſe they have been lately ſo victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious againſt us, ſince it often happens that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors at length are vanquiſhed by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All preſent were ſatisfied with this determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and being all diſmiſt, he called all his Sons who were not preſent at the debate, to whom he again declared his intention, with tears in his eyes to this purpoſe; <hi>Dear Sons, you ought never to forget the death of your Grand-father</hi> Laomedon, <hi>nor the ſervitude of your Aunt</hi> Heſione <hi>whom the</hi> Greeks <hi>our inveterate Enemies abuſe at their own pleaſure, which methinks ſhould

            </p>
            <p>To this ſpeech <hi>Hector</hi> returned this mild and diſcreet anſwer; <hi>Dear Father, and my Soveraign Lord; I am ſatisfied that there are none of your Sons but are ſufficiently inclined to require ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for any wrongs offered us, or any of our Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; according to the quality of the Perſon abuſed ſo doth the injury appear greater; It is natural to men to ſeek redreſs of injuries yea the very Beaſts by nature ſtrive to do the ſame; Neither, Moſt Dear Father, is there any of your Sons who ought more ſenſibly to reſent the Murder of our Lord and Grandfather than I who am the eldeſt;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44689:11"/>But I beſeech you before you undertake this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, to conſider ſeriouſly what may be the Iſſue and Event thereof, otherwiſe you may have cauſe to repent that ever it was begun; I ſpeak not this out of Contradiction or Cowardiſe, but only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce your Highneſs to take mature advice and deliberation in the matter. You know that all</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica <hi>and</hi> Europe <hi>are Subject to the</hi> Greeks, <hi>and that they abound with ſtout and valiant Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſo that our ſtrength in men at Arms is not comparable to theirs; Why therefore ſhould we who live in peace and quietneſs diſturb our own Welfare and Proſperity.</hi> Heſione <hi>is not of ſo much value that we ſhould indanger all our Lives and Eſtates only for her ſake; She hath been already a long time in</hi> Greece, <hi>and I think it were better ſhe ſhould ſpend the reſt of her days, which cannot be many, in that Countrey, than that we ſhould run ſuch great hazards to fetch her home again. I again declare, Dread Sir, I ſpeak not this for fear, or want of Courage, but becauſe the chance of War is uncertain, and leſt fortune by this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture ſhould confound and deſtroy our Realm, or at leaſt cauſe us to wiſh a thouſand times that we had never undertaken ſo dangerous an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</hi>

            <p>When <hi>Paris</hi> heard <hi>Hector</hi> thus declare his mind, he was much concerned, and ſtanding up ſay'd; <hi>Dread Lord, I beſeech you hear me one word; To what ill end can this undertaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the</hi> Greeks <hi>poſſibly come?

            <p>After this battle <hi>Agamemnon</hi> called a Council of War in his Tent, wherein they concluded that it was in vain to hope for ſucceſs againſt their Enemies till the valiant <hi>Hector</hi> was killed, and therefore they deſired <hi>Achilles</hi> as well for his Strength as wiſdom, to undertake it; <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>

            <p>The Battle was very bloody to the <hi>Trajans,</hi> and by the obſtinate Valour of the <hi>Greeks</hi> they were beaten back to the City Gates, and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getton</hi> one of <hi>Priamus</hi> natural Sons was ſlain by <hi>Achilles,</hi> which when <hi>Hector</hi> heard, he was ſo inraged, that putting on his helmet, he private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly got away into the Fight, where he ſoon diſpatcht ſeveral of the moſt forward Greek Captains, and again reſtored the Battle by his preſence, ſo that the <hi>Greeks</hi> lay dead on all ſides; When <hi>Achilles</hi> obſerved <hi>Hector</hi> to make ſuch havock of his Commanders, he concluded that all his indeavours or hopes of ſucceſs would be in vain whilſt <hi>Hector</hi> lived, and therefore taking a Noble <hi>Graecian</hi> with him call'd <hi>Policceus,</hi> they came upon him with the utmoſt fury ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, but <hi>Hector</hi> ſoon diſpatcht the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; <hi>Achilles</hi> reſolving to revenge his Death, aſſaulted him couragiouſly, but <hi>Hector</hi> threw a dart at him with ſuch violence that it wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in the thigh; <hi>Achilles</hi> retired to bind up his wound, and then returning to the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle with a very great Spear, wherewith he vowed to be the death of <hi>Hector,</hi> he found him carrying a <hi>Graecian</hi> Prince very richly armed out of the Field, having thrown his ſhield behind him for his eaſe and thereby left his breaſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; <hi>Achilles</hi> obſerving his advantage,

            <p>
               <hi>Hector</hi> being buried with much funeral Pomp and State, the <hi>Trojans</hi> fell upon the Greeks and cut off abundance of them in revenge of his death; To conclude, there were many ſlain, and much blood Spilt in the frequent Sallies of the beſieged, and <hi>Memnon</hi> whom the <hi>Trojans</hi> put their truſt in next to <hi>Hector</hi> being likewiſe ſlain, they were much terrified yet was <hi>Achilles</hi> ſoon after killed by <hi>Paris,</hi> at which they began to take courage again, and expreſs their Joy, but it laſted not long, for <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> the Son of <hi>Achilles</hi> being arrived from <hi>Greece,</hi> ſucceeded his Father in all his Offices, and had no leſs ſucceſs in the Encounters although he was very young; He revenged his death upon the <hi>Trojans</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:44689:17"/>in many Battles, in one of which he killed <hi>Paris.</hi> At laſt the beſieged were ſo unhappy as to ſee their <hi>Palladium,</hi> upon which they ſuperſtitiouſly believed the ſafety of their City did depend, ſtolen and carryed away privately by <hi>Uliſſes</hi> and <hi>Diomedes;</hi> You muſt know that <hi>Troy</hi> was firſt built by <hi>Dardania,</hi> and afterward inlarged by his great Grand-ſon <hi>Ilus,</hi> who named it <hi>Ilium;</hi> This Prince made his Prayer to the Gods, that they would pleaſe to give him ſome ſign, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they did approve of the Building this City; Immediately at his words (ſaith the Story) there fell down from above, the <hi>Palladium,</hi> which was an Image of three Cubits long, holding in one hand a Lance, and in the other a Spindle with a Diſtaff; The Statue no ſooner toucht the Earth, but it began to march in the preſence of the King. The Oracle afterward inform'd him, that <hi>Troy</hi> ſhould never be taken nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd whilſt that remained ſafe; <hi>Uliſſes</hi> and <hi>Diomedes</hi> ſtole ſecretly into the Citadel of <hi>Troy</hi> through a Gutter, and carried away the <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium;</hi> This cauſed King <hi>Priamus</hi> to come to an Agreement with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> but had no mind to reſtore <hi>Helena,</hi> who was Married to <hi>Deiphobus</hi> his Younger Son after the death of <hi>Paris.

            <p>This Peace was but a cheat that the <hi>Greeks</hi> might ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize them with leſs difficulty; When they raiſed the Siege, they pretended to leave behind them a Preſent for <hi>Minerva</hi> to appeaſe her Wrath, as if they had diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her by Stealing away and prophaning the <hi>Palladium;</hi> for that purpoſe they cauſed a Wooden Horſe of a Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious bigneſs to be made; In the Belly of it they ſhut up a great many of the ſtouteſt and ableſt Soldiers of the Army, and left it before the Walls of the City, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired with their whole Forces as if for good and all, but they went no farther than the Iſle of <hi>Tenedos,</hi> expecting to ſee the ſucceſs of their Enterprize. The Beſieged im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately go out of their City where they had been ſhut up ſo long, they viſit all the quarters of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Camp, they admire this great Wooden Horſe; At length they conſult whether they ſhould carry it into their City; Some were for it, others ſuſpected ſome deceit, among whom one <hi>Lacoon</hi> caſt his Lance againſt it, but ſeemed to be inſtantly puniſhed, for two dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Serpents immediately killed him and his two Children. This Accident cauſed them all to reſolve to drag this Wooden Engine into <hi>Troy.</hi> But they were far more eager when they heard the Relation and diſcourſe of one <hi>Sinon,</hi> a Fellow taught by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>liſſes</hi> for this purpoſe, and taken as a ſpy by the <hi>Trojans,</hi> who told them, That when the Fleet was ready to ſet ſail toward <hi>Greece,</hi> the Gods had demanded a <hi>Graecian</hi> to be ſacrificed to them that the Voyage might be proſperous, and that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>liſſes</hi> his mortal Enemy having cauſed the Lot to fall upon him, he was forced to run away and hide himſelf; Thus perſiſting in his diſſimulation, he told them that the deſign of the <hi>Greeks</hi> was to reconcile themſelves to the Goddeſs <hi>Pallas,</hi> and therefore they had dedicated unto her this Horſe, which they had cauſed to be made ſo large that it might not enter within the Walls of the City, and that the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans</hi> might not make uſe of it to their advantage; and to the prejudice of the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Diſcourſe removed out of their minds all Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and Suſpition, and cauſed them to reſolve to break

               <hi>ALexander</hi> the Great was the Son of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi> and <hi>Olympias;</hi> His Father after he ſubdued <hi>Greece,</hi> and was acknowledged their Captain General, liſted the Auxiliaries of ever City, by whom he was to be aſſiſted againſt any Invaſion, or to lead them forth againſt any Nation, for it was not doubted but that the Empire of the <hi>Perſians</hi> was the deſign of thoſe great preparations, the number of foot were two Hundred Thouſand, and fifteen Thouſand Horſe, beſides which he had an Army of <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and another of the barbarous Nations who were conquered, and borderers upon his Kingdom. In the Spring he ſent <hi>Parmenio, Amyntas</hi> and <hi>Atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> (whoſe Siſter he had lately Married, having divorc <hi>Olympias</hi> upon ſuſpition of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency) into that part of <hi>Aſia</hi> which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of the <hi>Perſians;</hi> But while the Auxiliaries of <hi>Greece</hi> were drawing into a Body, he celebrated the Nuptials of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> his Daughter and <hi>Alexander</hi> whom he had made King of <hi>Epirus;</hi> The day was remarkable for the magnificence of the Two Kings, the one Marrying, the other giving his Daughter in Marriage; Neither was there wanting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of Enterludes and Masks, to the behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof when King <hi>Philip</hi> paſſed without a Guard, between the two <hi>Alexanders</hi> his own Son and his Son in Law, <hi>Pauſanias</hi> one of the Nobility, being ſuſpected by none, Killed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44689:20"/>
               <hi>Philp</hi> as he was going through the croud, and made the day deſtined to mirth and Marriage, black with the lamentation of a funeral.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Pauſanias</hi> about the fourteenth year of his age was inforced to be a Proſtitute or Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite to <hi>Attalus,</hi> to which indignity this igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny was added that <hi>Attalus</hi> having afterwards brought him into the Banquet, and made him drunk, did not onely expoſe him to his own luſt, but to all his gueſts, and rendred him a common laughing ſtock among them, which <hi>Pauſanias</hi> reſenting with great indignation, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten complain'd of it to <hi>Philip,</hi> but finding that he was both deluded and delayed in his juſt complaints, &amp; likewiſe that his adverſary was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with a new addition of power &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he converted his anger againſt <hi>Philip</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, &amp; that revenge which he could not have on his adverſary he took on his unrightous Judge; <hi>Pauſanias</hi> was ſeized and crucified for the Fact.</p>
            <p>As there were divers Nations in the army of <hi>Philip,</hi> ſo he being ſlain, there were divers agitations of minds in them; In theſe diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions the coming of <hi>Alexander</hi> was a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign remedy, who in a very obliging Speech, quieted their minds, and procured to himſelf a very great eſteem from them; He was then but twenty years old, and gave exceeding hopes of a growing Vertue; He freed the <hi>Macedonians</hi> from all Tributes whatſoever, unleſs a diſcharge from the War, wherewith they were extreamly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44689:20"/>declaring that they had only loſt the Perſon but not the Vertue or valour of their King; He cauſed all who were guilty of his Fathers death to be ſlain at his Funeral; He awed many Nations who were ready to rebel, and marching privately into <hi>Greece,</hi> called the Magiſtrates of all the Citys to <hi>Corinth,</hi> by whom he was made General in the place of his Father, after which he proceeded in his prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for the <hi>Perſian</hi> War begun by his Father, during which he had notice that the <hi>Athenians, Lacedemonians and Thebans</hi> had revolted to the <hi>Perſians</hi> by the treachery of <hi>Demoſthens</hi> the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, who corrupted him with a great ſum of gold; But upon <hi>Alexanders</hi> approach they ſoon returned again to their obedience, the <hi>Thebans</hi> only perſiſting, who were thereupon quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubdued, their City levelled to the ground, and their Citizens ſold for Captives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> being now wholly intent upon the War in <hi>Aſia,</hi> put to death all his Kindred, or friends, that he imagined might nouriſh any aſpiring thoughts; After which having drawn his Army all into one Body, he ſpeedily imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued them, and being come within ſight of <hi>Aſia,</hi> inflamed with an incredible ardor of Spirit, he erected 12 Altars where he made his Vows to the Gods of War; He then divided all his Patrimony and Kingdom which he had in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> amongſt his Friends, alleag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44689:21"/>
               <hi>That</hi> Aſia <hi>was ſufficient for himſelf.</hi> And before any of his Ships Sailed he offered Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, <hi>deſiring Victory in this War, in which he was to be the Revenger of</hi> Greece <hi>ſo often invad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the</hi> Perſians, <hi>whoſe Empire was grown Old and Ripe for change, it being now high time that the Turn ſhould again come about when others who would uſe their power better ſhould enjoy it;</hi> Neither were the reſolutions of his Army leſs proſaging good fortune than his own, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting their Wives and Children and the War which was ſo far from their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, aſſured to themſelves the <hi>Perſian</hi> Gold and all the riches of the Eaſt, as if already in their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</p>
            <p>When they drew near the <hi>Aſian</hi> Shoar, <hi>Alexander</hi> firſt threw a dart, as into an Enemies Countrey, and leaping aſhoar in his Armour, vaulted twice or thrice into the Air; He there again ſacrificed, praying <hi>That thoſe Countreys might willingly receive him as King;</hi> He did the ſame at <hi>Ilium,</hi> upon the Tombs of thoſe who fell in the <hi>Trojan</hi> War; Advancing afterward towards the Enemy, he made Proclamation, <hi>That none of his Souldiers ſhould plunder, ſince they ought to ſpare their own goods, and not deſtroy what they came to poſſeſs;</hi> In his Army were thirty Two thouſand Foot, and Four Thouſand five Hundred Horſe, and a Fleet of one hundred eighty two Ships; With which inconſiderable Force it may ſeem wonderful he durſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44689:21"/>to overcome all the Weſtern World, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince his Army did not conſiſt of ſtout young men in the Flower of their Youth, but chiefly of Old Souldiers, ſome of whom by the Laws of War, ought for their age to have been diſcharged from further Service, being ſuch as ſerved both his Father and Grand-Father, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they now ſeem'd Select Maſters of War, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than private Souldiers, there being no File-leader who was not ſixty years old, the Order of the Camp being ſo excellent as it appeared like the Senate of ſome ancient Commonwealth, therefore in the Battle no man thought of flight but of Victory, having no hope in the nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Feet, but in the ſtrength of their Arms.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide <hi>Darius</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of his ſtrength, affirmed he would have nothing done by Policy or Circumvention, ſince it was not ſuitable to his Grandeur to ſteal a Victory, and therefore thought it more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to admit the Enemy to enter his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, than to fall upon him on the Borders: The firſt Battle was in the Plain of <hi>Adraſtum,</hi> where an Army of ſix hundred thouſand <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were overcome as much by the Policy of <hi>Alexander</hi> as the courage of the <hi>Macedons,</hi> great was the ſlaughter of the Enemy, whereas he loſt only nine Footmen, and one Hundred and Twenty Horſe, whom to incourage the reſt, he cauſed to be honourably buried, and Statues
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44689:22"/>were erected for them as for ſome memorable Commanders, beſtowing great Priviledges on their Relations and kindred; After this Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the greateſt part of <hi>Aſia</hi> ſubmitted to him; He alſo made many Wars with the Lieutenants of <hi>Darius,</hi> whom he overcame not ſo much by Arms as the Terror of his name.</p>
            <p>While he was thus Victorious he underſtood by a Captive that a Treaſon was contrived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him by <hi>Alexander</hi> Son in law to <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pater</hi> (then the Kings Lieutenant in <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>) but fearing if he ſhould put him to death it might occaſion ſome Tumult in <hi>Macedon,</hi> he only confined him to Priſon in Bonds; After this he advanced to <hi>Gordium,</hi> ſcituate between both the <hi>Phrygias,</hi> which City he deſired to be Maſter of, not ſo much for the plunder as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he heard that in the Temple of <hi>Jupiter</hi> which was within it, there was conſecrated the Plough of <hi>Gordius,</hi> the knots of whoſe cords if any could unloſe, the Oracle of Old had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaged he ſhould reign over all <hi>Aſia;</hi> The Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of the Story was this; When <hi>Gordius</hi> was ploughing in this Countrey with his Oxen, great flights of Birds of all ſorts flew round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, who going to the Southſayers and Aſtrologers of the next City to know the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he met at the Gate a Virgin of admirable Beauty, and asking her whether he ſhould go to be reſolved of his doubt, ſhe having ſome knowledge her ſelf in the Art by the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44689:22"/>of her Parents told him, <hi>That the Kingdom and Government of that Countrey was preſaged to him thereby, and offered him to be a companion of his good fortune by giving her ſelf in Marriage to him;</hi> He was unwilling to refuſe ſo fair a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſeemed the firſt felicity of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; After this Marriage a Sedition aroſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Phrygians,</hi> and counſel being asked, what would put an end to theſe miſchiefs, the Oracle replied, <hi>That there was a neceſſity of a King;</hi> And being again demanded, who he ſhould be, anſwer was made; <hi>That they ſhould make him King whom they ſhould find with a Plough entring into</hi> Jupiters <hi>Temple; Gordeus</hi> was the man, whom they preſently ſaluted as their King, who conſecrated to Regal Majeſty in that Temple the Plough, by which the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was conferred upon him. After him reigned his Son <hi>Midas,</hi> who being inſtructed by <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus</hi> in the Solemnities of Worſhipping their Gods, he filled all <hi>Phrygia</hi> with Religion and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, by which, during his life, he was thought ſafer than by Arms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> ſoon took the City, and entring the Temple, inquired for the Plough, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhewn him, when he could not diſcover the ends of the Cords lying hid amongſt the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the foldings, he gave a violent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation to the ſenſe of the Oracle, and cutting the cords aſunder with his ſword, the knots were undone, and he found the ends lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcovered
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44689:23"/>in the Myſtery of the Twiſts; Mean while he heard of <hi>Darius</hi> approach with a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Army, and fearing the danger of the Streights of <hi>Taurus,</hi> he marcht ſpeedily over that Mountain, his Foot going five hundred Furlongs without Reſpite; Coming to <hi>Tarſus</hi> and being taken with the pleaſant River <hi>Cydnus</hi> running through that City, he diſarmed and covered with duſt and ſweat, threw himſelf into it, which was ſo very cold, that it cauſed a Chilneſs and benuming in every joint, which rendred him Speechleſs, and made his condition very dangerous, and the more becauſe he had received letters that day from <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> that <hi>Philip</hi> his chief Phyſician in whom he put moſt confidence, was corrupted by <hi>Darius</hi> to deſtroy him: However the caſe being deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, he ordered him to prepare a potion, and having received the Cup, he delivered theſe Letters to him, and ſtedfaſtly beheld him as he drank the Phyſick, and obſerving no alteration in his countenance in reading them, he became more cheerful, and in four days was perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Darius</hi> advanced toward him with Three hundred thouſand Foot, and One hundred thouſand Horſe, and though the multitude of his enemies did ſomewhat diſturb him, yet when he reflected what mighty Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and what notable Conqueſts over many Nations he had performed with as few men,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44689:23"/>he reſumed his former courage, but thought it neceſſary by no means to delay fighting leaſt ſome diſcouragement might happen to his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and therefore riding through the midſt of his Troops, he by ſeveral Speeches and Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions endeavoured to confirm their valour, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, <hi>The World had no Souldiers compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them, and that this one Battle would put an end to their labours, but their glory and renown would remain for ever; Darius</hi> on the other ſide was no leſs induſtrious, admoniſhing his men not to forgot the ancient Glory of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire, and of their everlaſting poſſeſſion of it, which was granted them by the Immortal Gods.</p>
            <p>After this the Battle was fought with great reſolution, in which both Kings were wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Victory was doubtful till <hi>Darius</hi> fled, thereupon there followed a great ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> threeſcore and ten thouſand Foot, and ten thouſand Horſe being ſlain, and forty thouſand taken Priſoners; Of the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> were ſlain one Hundred and Thirty Foot, and one hundred and fifty Horſe; Much Gold, and other rich moveables were found in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Camp, and among the Captives there were the Mother and Wife of <hi>Darius,</hi> and his two Daughters, to comfort whom when <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> came in perſon with ſome Souldiers, they imbracing one onother expecting preſent death, made a Screaking lamentation, then hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling themſelves to the knees of <hi>Alexander,</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:44689:24"/>they deſired not life, but only a reprieve till they had buried <hi>Darius; Alexander</hi> moved at their Piety, aſſured them he was alive, and to remove from them the fear of death, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they ſhould be honoured as Queens, and that the daughters ſhould chuſe them Husbands according to their Quality; After which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the riches and precious furniture of <hi>Darius,</hi> he was poſſeſt with admiration, and then firſt began to delight in luxurious Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, and Feaſts, and to be tempted by the Beauties of <hi>Barſinoe</hi> his Captive, on whom he begot a Son, named <hi>Hercules.</hi> But conſidering <hi>Darius</hi> was yet alive, he commanded <hi>Parmenio</hi> to ſeize upon the <hi>Perſian</hi> Fleet, and ſent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commanders to take poſſeſſion of ſome Citys in <hi>Aſia,</hi> who ſoon delivered themſelves up with vaſt Sums of Gold, upon the ſame of this great Victory. He then advanced into <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> where many Kings of the Eaſt with Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets and Miters met him, ſome of whom he received as Friends, others he deprived of their Kingdoms, preferring new Kings, and among others, <hi>Abdolominus</hi> was by him choſen King of <hi>Sidonia,</hi> who before lived miſerably, his only imployment being to ſcour Ditches and water Gardens, <hi>Alexander</hi> rejecting the Nobility leaſt they ſhould impute their Royalty to their birth, and not his generoſity.</p>
            <p>The Citizens of <hi>Tyre</hi> ſending him a weighty Crown of Gold on pretence of gratifying him,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44689:24"/>the gift was gratefully accepted, and the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors were told, <hi>He would come thither him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and pay his vows to</hi> Hercules; Who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leging he might perform that better in the Old Town of <hi>Tyre</hi> in the ancient Church, he was ſo incenſed that he threatned utterly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy their City, and immediately drawing his Army to the Iſland, was reſolutely received by the <hi>Tyrians</hi> who depended on aſſiſtance from <hi>Carthage,</hi> but that failing, they were not long after ſurprized by Treachery and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; He then took <hi>Rhodes, Egypt</hi> and <hi>Cilicia</hi> upon compoſition, and reſolved to viſit the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Hamon</hi> to inquire of future events, and of his own Original, ſince his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Olympias</hi> had confeſſed to his Father <hi>Philip</hi> that <hi>Alexander</hi> was not begot by him, but by a vaſt great Serpent, and <hi>Philip</hi> a little before his death openly declared, <hi>That</hi> Alexander <hi>was not his Son,</hi> and divorced <hi>Olympias</hi> as guilty of incontinence. <hi>Alexander</hi> therefore being am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of being a God, and to free his Mother from diſgrace, ſent ſome before hand with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to the Prieſts, ordering them what anſwers they ſhould return, ſo that entring the Temple, they inſtantly ſaluted him as the Son of <hi>Hamon,</hi> who being joyful of this adoption by this Deity, commanded that <hi>Jupiter Hamon</hi> ſhould be eſteemed his Father; He then demanded, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther full Revenge had been taken of his Fathers Murtherers.</hi> It was anſwered, <hi>That his Father
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44689:25"/>could neither be killed, nor dye, but the Revenge for King</hi> Philip <hi>was fully perform'd;</hi> In Anſwer to a third demand it was ſaid, <hi>That both Victory in all Wars and the poſſeſſion of all Lands was granted to him;</hi> His Commanders and Intimates were likewiſe enjoyn'd by the Prieſt to worſhip him as a God, and not as a King. From hence he was poſſeſſed with wonderful inſolence and pride, altogether eſtranging himſelf from his former familiarity learnt of the <hi>Graecians</hi> and <hi>Macedonians;</hi> He then built <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and ſetled a Colony of <hi>Macedons</hi> there, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſhould be the Chief City of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Darius</hi> flying to <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſent Letters to <hi>Alexander</hi> offering him a vaſt ſum of money for redeeming the Captive Ladies, who returned anſwer, <hi>That to redeem them, he muſt not only give his money but his Empire. Darius</hi> ſoon after writ again, propoſing his Daughter in Marriage, and a great part of the Empire, but <hi>Alexander</hi> writ back, <hi>That he gave him only what was his own before,</hi> and commanded him to come as a Suppliant to him, and to permit the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to diſpoſe of the Kingdom at his own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; <hi>Darius</hi> hereby diſpairing of Peace, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared again for War, and advanced againſt <hi>Alexander</hi> with four hundred thouſand Foot, and one hundred thouſand Horſe; In his march he was informed his Wife was dead, and that <hi>Alexander</hi> had been extreamly kind to her and the reſt, lamenting her death, and aſſiſting at
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44689:25"/>her Funeral, and that he often went to comfort his Mother and Daughters, whereat he confeſſed; <hi>He was truly Conquered, ſince after ſo many Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles his Enemy had likewiſe overcome him in kindneſs, and that it was ſome comfort to him in his Miſery, to be ſubdued by ſo gallant an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</hi> He thereupon writ the third time to him, giving him many thanks for his Civil Reſpects to his Family, offering his other Daughter, and the greater part of his Kingdom, even to the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and thirty thouſand Talents for the other Captives; <hi>Alexander</hi> anſwered, <hi>That giving thanks to an Enemy was ſuperfluous, neither had he done any thing either for Flattery, fear of future events, or in hope of peace, but out of the greatneſs of his mind, whereby he had learnt to contend againſt the Forces, but not the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of his Enemies; He promiſed to allow the ſame grants to</hi> Darius, <hi>if he would be his ſecond, not his equal, but as the World could not be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by two Suns, no more could it endure the Government of two ſuch great Empires in a ſafe condition, therefore</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Come if you will, and this very day ſurrender your ſelf to me, or elſe prepare for Battle the next, wherein you have no reaſon to promiſe your ſelf any beter ſucceſs than you have already found.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next day both Armies ſtood ready to fight, at which inſtant <hi>Alexander</hi> poſſeſt with too much care, fell into a deep ſleep, and was hardly wak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Parmenio,</hi> and all admiring that he who
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44689:26"/>ſlept little, ſhould now be overcome therewith, in ſo great danger, he replied, <hi>That his being delivered from a great fear was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, ſince now he was to fight with all the Forces of</hi> Darius <hi>at once, being before afraid the War would be delayed ſhould the</hi> Perſians <hi>have divided their Army;</hi> Before the Battle, both Armies viewed each other, the <hi>Macedons</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired the multitude, greatneſs of Body and Beautiful Armor of their Enemies. The <hi>Perſians</hi> were amazed to think how often ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of them had been overcome with ſo few Soldiers; <hi>Alexander</hi> bid his Soldiers, <hi>Not be troubled at the multitude or ſtrength of their Enemies, but to conſider this was the third time they had fought with them, and that they were never the more valiant for flying away ſo often, that they ought to deſpiſe an Army ſhining with Gold and Silver, ſince their Iron would ſoon pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it to themſelves.</hi> Then both Armies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging the <hi>Macedonians</hi> in contempt of the Enemy ſo often conquered, threw themſelves upon the Swords of their Adverſaries, and the <hi>Perſians</hi> deſired rather manfully to dye than be again defeated, ſeldom more bloud was ſhed in any Fight; <hi>Darius</hi> ſeeing his Forces routed would willingly have died himſelf, but thoſe next him compelled him to fly, ſome perſwaded him to break down the Bridge of <hi>Cydnus,</hi> and ſtop the Enemies progreſs; who anſwered, <hi>That he would not provide for his ſafety ſo diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44689:26"/>by expeſing ſo many thouſands of his own Soldiers to the fury of the Enemy, who ought to be allowed the ſame way to eſcape which lay open to himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

This reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to dye continued with him ſeveral days after; The remembrance of his Nurſe who was Siſter to <hi>Clytus</hi> ſtill renewed his griefe, for making her ſo cruel a recompence for the nouriſhment ſhe had given him, and that being a young man and a Conqueror he ſhould requite her who brought him up in her arms with Bloud and Murder.

            <p>The perſwaſions of <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher and his familiar acquaintance prevailed much upon him, being bred up with him in the School of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and whom he ſent for on purpoſe to record his Conqueſts and Victorys.

            <p>Having marcht almoſt through all <hi>India,</hi> he came at length to a Rock as wonderful for its bigneſs as aſcent, into which many Nations fled for ſecurity, and underſtood that <hi>Hercules</hi> was by an Earthquake hindred from taking it; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereupon tranſported with ambition to tranſcend the Actions and labours of <hi>Hercules,</hi> he with almoſt infinite difficulty and danger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44689:31"/>came Maſter of it, and took into his protection all the Nations thereabout. One of the <hi>Indian</hi> Kings named <hi>Porus,</hi> was as admirable for his ſtrength of Body as greatneſs of Mind, who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notice of <hi>Alexanders</hi> advance, prepared an Army to entertain him; The Battles being joyned, he damanded of the <hi>Macedons</hi> their King, being reſolved as a private Enemy to fight with him hand to hand. <hi>Alexander</hi> made no delay to anſwer him, and in the firſt encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter falling headlong to the ground, his Horſe being killed under him, he was preſerved by the concourſe of his Guard. <hi>Porus</hi> almoſt cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Bloud from the many wounds received, was taken Priſoner, and had ſuch Indignation to be overcome, that though he had Quarter given he would receive no ſuſtenance, nor ſuffer his wounds to be dreſſed, being with much difficulty perſwaded to be contented to live. <hi>Alexander</hi> in honour of his valor ſent him back ſafe to his own Kingdom; He erected there two Citys, one called <hi>Nicea,</hi> and the other <hi>Bucephale</hi> after the name of his Horſe; He then overthrew the Armies of the <hi>Adreſtians</hi> and divers other people, and marching to the <hi>Euphitans</hi> he found they attended his coming with an Army of two hundred thouſand Horſe, whereupon all his Souldiers being tired as well by the number of their victories as their labours, humbly beſought him with tears <hi>To put a period to his Wars, and now at laſt to think of returning to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44689:31"/>their Countrey, intreating him to conſider the years of his Souldiers, whoſe age could ſcarce ſuffice to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them home again;</hi> Some ſhewed their grey hairs, others their Wounds, ſome their Bodies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed with ſickneſs, others their loſs of Bloud, which they had freely ſhed in continual war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare both with himſelf and Father, and therefore deſired <hi>That the remains of their worn bodys might be buried in the graves of their Anceſtors, and however if he would not ſpare them, Yet that he would ſpare himſelf, and not tempt his good Fortune by venturing it too far.</hi> Moved with theſe juſt petitions, he to give an end to his Victorys, commanded his Camp to be made exceeding mangnificent, that by the large Extent thereof the Enemy ſhould be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and his fame admired in future ages; His Souldiers never undertook any thing more readily, and then falling upon their formidable enemy with all their might, they ſoon put that undiſciplined multitude to flight, and with great Joy returned to their Quarters.</p>
            <p>From thence he marched to the River <hi>Ace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines,</hi> on which he ſaild to the Ocean, where two Nations of whom <hi>Hercules</hi> was the founder ſubmitted to him, from whence he ſaild to the <hi>Sycambrians</hi> who with fourſcore and three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand armed Foot, and threeſcore thouſand Horſe were ready to receive him. Having overthrown them in the Field, he came to their chief City, and being himſelf the firſt
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44689:32"/>man that ſcaled the Walls, when he found them unguarded, he leaped down into the City alone without any guard. The Enemy ſeeing him ſingle with a great ſhout ran toward him from every place, hoping by the death of one man to end the Wars of all the World, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the quarrel of ſo many Nations. <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> reſolutely reſiſted them, and fought alone againſt ſo many. Thouſands. It is incredible to be ſpoken that neither the multitude of his Foes, the fury of their weapons, nor the cries they made to incourage one another, could any way affright him, he alone kill'd and put to flight ſo many, but at length finding he was overpowered, he got to the body of a Tree cloſe under the Wall, where he a long time ſuſtained their fury, till his Soldiers underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his danger, leapt down to his aſſiſtance, many of whom were ſlain, and the Battle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued doubtful until the Walls being beat down, his whole Army came to his reſcue. In this Fight being ſhot with an Arrow under the breaſt, he fainted with loſs of Bloud, yet fought ſo long with one knee on the ground till he had killed two who wounded him.</p>
            <p>The cure was more grievous than the wound, but being at laſt recovered, though with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream difficulty, he ſent <hi>Polypercan</hi> with his Army to <hi>Babylon,</hi> he himſelf going with a Select party aboard his Fleet to make further diſcovery of the Ocean, and landing at the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44689:32"/>City of King <hi>Ambigerus,</hi> the Inhabitants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving he could not be overcome by the Sword, poiſoned their Darts, wherewith they forced him from the Walls, and killed many of his Souldiers, among others <hi>Ptolomy</hi> was deadly wounded, and being ready to expire, an herb was ſhown to <hi>Alexander</hi> in a dream, which being found and ſteeped in his drink, recovered <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and the greater part of the Army; At length the City being taken, he returned to his Ships and Sacrificed to the Ocean, imploring a happy return into his Countrey, and at length arrived at the Mouth of the River <hi>Indus,</hi> where as a Monument of his Atcheivements he built the City of <hi>Barſe</hi> and Erected Altars, and having left a Governor over the <hi>Indians,</hi> he marched toward <hi>Babylon,</hi> digging Wells by the way to procure freſh Water to his tired Souldiers; Hither many of the Conquered Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had ſent their Ambaſſadors to accuſe his Lieutenants of Oppreſſion and Cruelty, whom <hi>Alexander</hi> without any reſpect to friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip cauſed to be put to death in their preſence.</p>
            <p>After this he Married <hi>Statyra, Darius</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and gave the moſt noble Virgins of all Nations for Wives to his Princes, thereby to mitigate his own fault. He then called his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my together, and promiſed to pay all their Debts, that they might carry home all their Booty and pay entire, which munificence was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for the vaſtneſs of the Sum, Twenty
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44689:33"/>three Thouſand Talents being laid out in this affair; His old Souldiers being thus ſent home, the younger were much diſpleaſed, and began to mutiny that they had not the ſame favour, ſome of whom <hi>Alexander</hi> chaſtized, and perſwaded others, but at length finding words would not prevail, he leapt unarmed from his Throne, among the Armed multitude, and ſeizing twelve of the chief Authors of the Sedition, hurried them to Execution, none daring to offer the leaſt reſiſtance. Calling then together the <hi>Perſian</hi> Souldiers, he extolled their conſtant fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity both to himſelf and their former Kings, and declarcd he would now commit himſelf to their Cuſtody and no longer to the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons;</hi> And accordingly choſe a thouſand of them for his Life-Guard, mingling alſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Regiments of <hi>Perſians</hi> among his <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> to learn their diſcipline, which his Army took ſo much to heart, that all weeping they repaired to him, beſeeching him rather to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them than to put ſuch a ſevere affront upon them, by which ſubmiſſion they prevailed ſo far that he diſmiſt and ſent back to <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> Eleven thouſand of his Old Souldiers, and their pay was continued to them in their return as if they had ſtill ſerved.</p>
            <p>At this time <hi>Epheſtion</hi> one of his Favourites, both for his Beauty, Youth, and Wiſdom died, whom <hi>Alexander</hi> below the dignity of a King, lamented a long time, erecting him a Tomb

            <p>Returning to <hi>Babylon</hi> from the furtheſt Coaſts of the Ocean, he had notice that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors from <hi>Carthage</hi> and other Cities in <hi>Africa,</hi> as alſo from <hi>Spain, Sicily, France, Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia,</hi> and divers Cities in <hi>Italy,</hi> attended his Arrival, the Terror of his name having ſo poſſeſt the World, that all Nations ſubmitted to him as a King deſtin'd to be their Ruler. For this cauſe, approaching <hi>Babylon</hi> to keep as it were a Parliament of the whole World, ſome Magicians adviſed him not to enter that City, affirming it would be fatal to him, therefore declining it, he turn'd aſide to <hi>Berſia,</hi> a City heretofore unpeopled on the other ſide <hi>Euphrates</hi> where he was importuned by <hi>Anaxarchus</hi> the Philoſopher to deſpiſe the Preſages of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians as falſe and uncertain, and if proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Deſtiny or Nature not to be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Going therefore to <hi>Babylon,</hi> after a while he again prepared a Solemn Feaſt, which he had for ſome time intermitted, where he devoted himſelf abſolutely to mirth, both day and night; After which <hi>Theſſalus</hi> his Phyſician invited him and his Companions to another debauch, where taking the Cup into his hand, in the middle of his draught, he groaned as if he had been ſtruck through with a Sword, and his Body became ſo extream tender that he complained if but touched, as though he had
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44689:34"/>been wounded; His Friends ſaid, his diſeaſe was occaſioned by exceſs of Wine, though it were really Treaſon, the infamy whereof the power of his Succeſſors did ſuppreſs. The Author of this Treaſon was <hi>Antipater,</hi> who when he beheld his deareſt friends commanded to death, his Son in law ſlain, and himſelf who had performed ſuch conſiderable Service in <hi>Greece</hi> diſreſpected, and accuſed by his Mother <hi>Olympias</hi> of many inſolencies, and likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered his late ſeverity to his Lieutenants, and expected the ſame treatment, to make ſure work with the King, he ſuborned his ſon <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſender,</hi> with his Brother <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Jolla,</hi> who uſed to miniſter to him, to poiſon him; So great was the ſtrength of the Poyſon, that it could not be contained in Iron, Braſs, nor any thing but a Horſes hoof, <hi>Caſſander</hi> was bid to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt none but <hi>Theſtalus,</hi> ſo that when the Feaſt was in his houſe, after <hi>Philip</hi> haſt taſted the Kings Cup, having the poyſon ready in cold Water, they put it into the Wine; Four days after <hi>Alexander</hi> finding Death cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly approaching, ſaid, <hi>He believed it was the fate of his Family to dye about thirty years Old.</hi> After which he pacified his Souldiers who were ready to mutiny, ſuſpecting he periſht by Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, being therefore brought into the higheſt place of the City, he admitted all into his preſence, and gave them his right hand to kiſs, and when all wept, he appear'd without the leaſt trouble,

            <p>Having paſſed his Army over the River, and joined with the Tribunes of the People, who being expelled out of the City, retired to him; He made an Oration to his Souldiers, and with Tears in his Eyes implor'd their Fidelity and Aſſiſtance, affirming he would ſtrip himſelf of all rather than any ſhould go unſatisfied who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted his Honour; After this he poſſeſt himſelf of ſeveral Towns, and marching toward <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſium</hi> whither <hi>Pompey</hi> and the Conſuls were fled for more ſpeedy tranſportation, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to prevent them but in vain, and ſo return'd to <hi>Rome</hi> with his Army, where cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Senate together, and adviſing about the moſt weighty matters of State, he then marched into <hi>Spain</hi> againſt the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of <hi>Pompeys</hi> Forces, commanded then by three Lieutenants, ſaying at his going thither, <hi>That he was now going againſt an Army without a General, but at his return his next Expedition would be againſt a General</hi> (meaning <hi>Pompey</hi>) <hi>without an Army.</hi> He was oppoſed at <hi>Marſeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> but at length he reduced it, and ſetled <hi>Spain</hi> in a ſhort time. Coming back to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ordering all things there according to his own mind, he marched againſt <hi>Pompey</hi> himſelf, and beſiege him in his own Camp four Months

When <hi>Pompeys</hi> head was preſented him he wept bitterly, and cauſed him to be honourably buried, ſaying, <hi>I lament</hi> Pompeys <hi>Fall, and fear my own Fortune;</hi> And finding many Letters in his Coffers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by divers ſhewed their good will to <hi>Pompey,</hi> and hatred toward him, he never read them, but inſtantly burnt them all, leſt being exaſperated by them he ſhould have been tempted to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſome great miſchief; When <hi>Pompeys</hi> Images were thrown down, he ſet them up again, which made <hi>Cicero</hi> ſay, <hi>That</hi> Caeſar <hi>in ſetting up</hi> Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peys <hi>Images again made his own ſtand ſurer.</hi> He accounted his Conqueſt of the two Sons of <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great in <hi>Andaluzia</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> the

On the day of his <hi>Gallick</hi> Triumph the Axletree of his Chariot breaking, he had like to have been caſt upon the ground, He aſcended to the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44689:43"/>Capitol with lights, having forty Elephants at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending him on both hands, with carriers of Torches. In his <hi>Ponitck</hi> Triumph upon the ſeveral Pageants this Motto was inſcribed, <hi>Veni, Vidi, Vici, I came, I ſaw, I overcame,</hi> alluding to the expedition of his Conqueſts. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed very great gifts and poſſeſſions upon his Old Souldiers, and exhibited ſeveral Prizes, Stage-Plays, and other magnificent ſhews to pleaſe the People; And applying himſelf to the Settlement of the State, he reformed the Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which was then become confuſed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it to that Account which from him is to this day called the <hi>Julian Account.</hi> He filled up the Senate according to his own mind, none daring refuſe to chuſe whom he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. In the adminiſtration of Juſtice he was diligent and ſevere, and reduced the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy of Coaches, Diet and Cloths.</p>
            <p>His ſtature was tall, his complextion white, his limbs ſtrong and compact, his viſage full, his eyes black and lively, his temper ſound and healthy, only in his latter days he was ſubject to Swounding fits, and to be affrighted in his Dreams; Twice he was ſurprized with the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-ſickneſs as he ſate in judgment His bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was a great trouble to him, and had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten expoſed him to the ſcoffs of his Enemies, and therefore among all the Honours conferred upon him by the Senate and People, he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed none with more delight than the priveledge
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44689:43"/>of wearing a Laurel Garden perpetually; In his Cloths he was ſingularly remarkable, wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his long Senators Robe ſtudded with Gold, fringed at the hands and girt about, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways looſly, which gave occaſion to that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Sylla,</hi> who oft admoniſht the Nobility, <hi>To beware of that Boy who went girded ſo ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> He was exceedingly addicted to Neatneſs, and ſumptuous Hoſpitality at his Table; It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported he undertook the Voyage into <hi>Great Brittain</hi> in expectation of Pearls, whoſe value he could judg by poiſing them in his hands; He was a great Lover, and a moſt curious Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of Jewels, Seals, Pictures, Statues, and all kind of Antiquities; He Spared no coſt for Slaves if young and handſome. He kept his Houſe in ſuch exact Diſcipline, even in little things as well as great, that he clapt one of his Servants into Irons, for giving ſome Gueſts worſe bred than himſelf, and puniſhed another of his Gentlemen whom he much favoured, with death, for committing Adultery with the wife of a <hi>Roman</hi> Knight, though no complaint was brought againſt him.</p>
            <p>Yet the general report was that himſelf was much given to Women, (if not worſe) and with his liberality debauched many Ladys of Quality, and among others <hi>Mutia</hi> the wife of <hi>Pompey,</hi> who was often upbraided, <hi>That out of an extravagant ambition of greatneſs he had Married Caeſars Daughter for whoſe ſake he had

He abſtained from no way of getting Money in his Civil and Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Commands, and maintained his Civil Wars, Triumphs, and ſhews by all manner of Rapine and Sacriledge. In Eloquence and Martial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct he excelled the beſt of his Predeceſſors, none being more pungent nor frequent in his Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or more Neat and Elegant in his words. He writ the Commentaries of his own Actions in the Wars of <hi>France</hi> and againſt <hi>Pompey,</hi> in ſo Judicious, Eloquent and Modeſt a Stile, as juſtly makes it a queſtion whether he writ or fought with the greater Spirit.</p>
            <p>At his Weapon, and riding the Great Horſe he was excellently expert, and in labour moſt indefatigable, marching conſtantly at the head of his Army, both on Horſeback and a foot, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with his head bare in all weathers. His di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence was ſo incredible, that upon an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he would go fifty Leagues a day in a <hi>Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> Chariot, ſwimming over Rivers if any were in his way, or elſe paſſing over with blown Bladders, ſo as he out-ran all Intelligence of him.

Having notice that his Camp was Beſieged in <hi>Germany,</hi> he paſſed the Enemies Guards diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed like a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and came ſafe to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. No Religious ſcruple ever hindered his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; when he went againſt <hi>Juba,</hi> the Beaſt ran away juſt as it was to be Sacrificed, which was thought an ill Omen, yet he valued it not; As he was getting out of the Ship he fell to the ground, but perverting the bad preſage he cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, <hi>I take poſſeſſion of thee</hi> O Africk. When he ſaw any Battle doubtful he diſmounted his Troopers, and ſent away all their Horſes and his own firſt, that it being impoſſible to eſcape, they might either Fight or Dye. He rid upon a moſt remarkable Horſe, whoſe Feet were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt like a Mans, the Hoofs being cloven to the Toes, he bred him up from a Colt with great care, becauſe the Aſtrologers declared, <hi>That Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Maſter ſhould have the Empire of the World;</hi> Neither would the Horſe ſuffer any Body upon him, but <hi>Caeſar</hi> who back't him himſelf.</p>
            <p>He ſeveral times reſtored the Battle when it was almoſt loſt, by oppoſing himſelf againſt them that fled, taking them by the Throats, and forcing their Faces toward the Enemy. After the Battle of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> going to Sea in a Bark by himſelf, he met with ten of the Enemies Ships, and ſtoutly commanded them to yield, which they inſtantly performed. At the Siege of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as he was attempting the Bridge,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44689:46"/>the Enemy made a deſperate Sally, and forced him into a Boat, into which others throwing themſelves, he leapt into the Sea, and ſwam two hundred paces to the next Ship, though he held his left hand above water to preſerve ſome Papers, and haled his Generals Robe after him with his Teeth leſt it ſhould fall into his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries hands; He conſidered his Souldiers nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by their Qualities nor Wealth, but their Courage and Strength, uſing them all alike, with the ſame ſeverity and indulgence, and would oft give them falſe Alarms; If they were at any time diſcouraged with the report of the number of their Enemies, he would not leſſen but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their number above what was true. As upon the approach of <hi>Juba</hi> whoſe power was terrible to them, he called them together, and ſaid; <hi>Know that in few days</hi> Juba <hi>will be here with ten Legions, thirty Thouſand men at Arms, an hundred Thouſand Horſe, and three hundred Elephants. Therefore let every one forbear to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire or concern himſelf further, for I am ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently informed; and if any preſume to diſcourage you, I will put him into the oldeſt Ship I can get, &amp; expoſe him to the mercy of the Winds and Flouds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He neither took notice of all faults, nor pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them alike; Thoſe that were ſeditious or deſerted their Colours he puniſht ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; After a Victory he would abate his ſtrict Diſcipline, ſuffering all their Riot and Luxury, boaſting often, <hi>That his Souldiers could fight in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44689:47"/>their very perfumes.</hi> He uſed to call them his Companions and Fellow Souldiers, and kept them always brave in Arms ſhining with Gold and Silver that they might fight more ſtoutly if but to ſave their Armor, he loved them ſo well that hearing of the defeat of his party under <hi>Titurius,</hi> he let his Beard and Hair grow for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation till he was throughly revenged; By which obliging carriage his Souldiers had ſuch an entire affection for him, that when he firſt undertook the Civil wars, there was not a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in his Legions but offered to find him a Horſe out of their own pay, neither did any forſake him, and though taken by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and offered their lives to take up Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, choſe rather to dye; They indured hunger and other extremities of War with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary conſtancy, and when repulſed at <hi>Dyracchium,</hi> they came and offered themſelves to be puniſhed, So that <hi>Caeſar</hi> had more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to comfort than correct them. During his ten years War in <hi>Gaul</hi> they never mutined, in his Civil Wars but ſeldom, and then returned preſently to their duty; After he had made himſelf Emperor he advanced Perſons of the meaneſt condition to the higheſt honours, for which being blamed, he ſaid, <hi>If they were Thieves and Murtherers and had ſtuck to me in defence of my honour, I would have done the ſame.</hi>

            <p>He was not naturally revengeful, and for Clemency and Moderation was admirable;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44689:47"/>At the Battle of <hi>Pharſalia</hi> he proclaimed, <hi>That all Citizens ſhould be ſpared; And none were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led but in the heat of fight.</hi> And having infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of ſeveral conſpiracies and meetings in the night, he troubled them no further than by Edict to let them know they were diſcovered. To ſuch as ſpoke ill of him, he thought it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to admoniſh them before the People to deſiſt for the future, and being ſeverely aſperſt by Libels whoſe Authors were in his Power, he took all patiently without revenge. Yet many of his Speeches and his Irregular Actions ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently diſcover that he much abuſed his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and committed many Capital Crimes; For beſides the extravagant Honours he aſſumed, as the perpetual Dictatorſhip, the continual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip, the Cenſorſhip, the Title of Emperor and Father of his Countrey, a Statue among the Kings, a Chair of Gold in the Senate, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Courts of Juſtice; He uſurped grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dignities than became a Man, as to have his Image carried like a God in the <hi>Cercenſian</hi> Games; He had his Temples, Altars, and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges placed by the Gods, his conſecrated Beds and his Prieſts; In ſhort there were no Honours whatever, but he took or gave as he pleaſed. Nor did his publick Expreſſions ſpeak him leſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, ſaying uſually, <hi>The Common-wealth was now but a word without either Body or Soul. That</hi> Sylla <hi>was no good Grammarian to part with his Dictatorſhip ſo eaſily; That hereafter he
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44689:48"/>was to be ſpoke to with more reverence, and every word he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered was to be lookt on as a Law.</hi> Nay ſo confident was he grown that when a Beaſt in Sacrifice was found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Heart, which the Spectators ſaid was an ill Omen; <hi>Trouble not your ſelves</hi> ſays he, <hi>theyſhall be better when I pleaſe, nor is it to be thought a Prodigie if a Beaſt wants a Heart,</hi> But the moſt cruel, and deſperate hatred againſt him roſe from hence, that when the Senate came to him in a Body with moſt Honourable Decrees, he received them ſitting before the Temple of <hi>Venus;</hi> And in one of his Triumpts paſſing by the Seats of the Tribunes, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving all the Company roſe up and ſaluted him but <hi>P. Aquilla</hi> the Tribune, he in great indignation cryed out; <hi>Well done Tribune</hi> Aquilla, <hi>you had beſt try if you can wreſt the Government of the Common-wealth out of my hands with your Tribune-ſhip;</hi> When at a Feſtival one had put a Crown of Laurel on his Statue, and the Tribunes order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to be taken off, he was ſo offended, taking it for an ill Omen of his Coronation, that he ſharply rebuked them and turned them out of their Commands. He ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſome Perſons to ſalute him with the Title of King; And it was affirmed that he reſolved ſuddenly to declare his Opinion that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould be called King, becauſe he found in the Books of the <hi>Sybyls,</hi> that the <hi>Parthians</hi> were not to be Conquered but by a King.</p>
            <p>This was the great occaſion of haſtening the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy againſt him, and their Councels were now united, the People growing ſenſible of their condition, and wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſome Body to aſſert their Liberties; ſome writ under the Statue of the former <hi>Brutus, Would to God thou were alive again;</hi> Others under <hi>Caeſars</hi> Image, <hi>Brut us was created the firſt Conful for expelling Kings, and this man the laſt of Kings for ſuppreſſing Conſuls;</hi> The Conſpiracy was managed by above threeſcore Perſons, the chief were <hi>C. Caſſius, Marcus</hi> and <hi>Decimus Brutus,</hi> they long delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated whether to throw him over the Bridge, or to kill him at his entrance into the Theater, but when the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate had Order to meet in <hi>Pompeys</hi> Court upon the Ides of <hi>March,</hi> they preferred that time and place before all the reſt.</p>

               <hi>Caeſar</hi> had warning of his death by many Preſages; In digging up ſome Sepulcher, at <hi>Capua,</hi> they found in the Monument of <hi>Capys</hi> Founder of that City, a Braſs Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with this Inſcription in <hi>Greek, When the Bones of</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pys <hi>ſhall be diſcovered, it ſhall come to paſs that a Perſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from</hi> Julus <hi>ſhall be murdered by his Kindred, and his death revenged a while after with the ruin of all</hi> Italy; Not many days before this diſaſter, his Horſes which he had conſecrated at his paſſage over the <hi>Rubicon,</hi> being turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Fields, refuſed to eat, and ſeem'd to weep abundantly.

But God promiſed him they ſhould have a ſafe paſſage over; <hi>Joſhua</hi> therefore waited with his Army two days, and then paſſed over the River, the Prieſts going firſt with the Ark, who as ſoon as they had ſet their feet in the Water, which was then very high, it being in harveſt, the Waters from above roſe up in an heap, and the Prieſts ſtood on dry ground in the midſt of <hi>Jordan</hi> till all the People paſſed quite over, and then according to Gods command, they took out of the middle of the River Twelve Stones wherewith to build an Altar for a Memorial to after-ages of this wonderful deliverance; And all things being finiſht, the Prieſts came out of the River, which inſtantly after flowed with as much violence as before; Whilſt the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did all this, the <hi>Canaanites</hi> never ſallied out upon them, but diſmayed with fear, kept themſelves within the Walls of <hi>Jericho,</hi> which <hi>Joſhua</hi> reſolved to beſiege with all his Forces; But God commanded him that on the firſt day of the feaſt, the Prieſts leaving the Ark and guarded on every ſide with Troops of armed men ſhould draw near <hi>Jericho,</hi> ſound-Seven Rams horns, and at night to return to their Camp;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44689:52"/>This they performed ſix days together, but on the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, <hi>Joſhua</hi> aſſembled the People early, and cauſed them to incompaſs the City ſeven times that day, and the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets ſounding with great force, the Walls by the power of God without any violence uſed by the Hebrews, fell down flat to the ground, ſo that entring the City over the ruines they put all within it to the Sword, the Enemy through the ſudden aſtoniſhment that fell upon them being unable to reſiſt, and ſo great was the ſlaughter that they neither ſpared Women nor Children, but filled the City with dead Carcaſes, which at length being ſet on fire ſerved for a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral flame to conſume them; Only <hi>Rahab</hi> and her houſhold were ſaved by the Spies, and <hi>Joſhua</hi> beſtowed an Inheritance upon her; and ever after held her in great honour.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Joſhua</hi> denounced Curſes on thoſe who ſhould endeavour to rebuild this City, foretelling. That he ſhould lay the foundation thereof in the days of his Eldeſt Son, and ſhould loſe his youngeſt ere it was finiſhed. There was much Spoil taken both of Gold, Silver, and Braſs in this City, and <hi>Joſhua</hi> having before commanded that all the Gold and Silver ſhould be brought to one place to offer to God as the firſt fruits for his aſſiſtance, none of them, but only one man, kept any thing to himſelf, all being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Prieſts to be laid up in the Treaſury, but <hi>Achan</hi> the Son of <hi>Zebedias</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> having got the Kings Coat imbroidered with Gold, and a Wedge of Gold of two hundred Shekels in weight, and thinking it unjuſt that what he had got with the hazard of his Life ſhould be taken from him, he digged a Pit in his Tent and buried his Spoils therein, deſigning to defraud God as well as his Companions.</p>
            <p>At this time the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Ten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s were pitched in <hi>Gilgal,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Liberty,</hi> becauſe being delivered from <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage, and the wants of the wilderneſs they now thought they had nothing more to fear; A few days after the diſtruction of <hi>Jericho Joſhua</hi> ſent out three thouſand armed men againſt <hi>Ai,</hi> a City hard by, who encountring with their adverſarys, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were put
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44689:53"/>to flight and loſt thirty ſix men; The news of this diſaſter being brought to the Camp, they were much aſtoniſhed, not only for the men they had loſt, but diſpairing of future ſucceſs, ſince they perſwaded themſelves they were already Maſters of the Feild, and that their Army ſhould be always Victorious according to the promiſe of God, and that this advantage would much incourage their Enemies; So that cloathing themſelves in Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, they ſpent three days in tears and lamentations without taking any meat; When <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſaw them thus dejected, falling on his face to the Earth he thus addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf to God. <hi>O Lord thou knoweſt we have not been induced by our own raſhneſs and temerity to attempt the Conqueſt of this Land by force, but have been thereunto incouraged by thy Servant</hi> Moſes <hi>to whom thou didſt promiſe by divers ſigns to give us this Country to inhabit, and that our Armys ſhould always have the Victory in Battle, and of theſe thy promiſe we have oftimes experienced the certain accompliſhment; But now O Lord what ſhall I ſay when</hi> Iſrael <hi>turneth their backs before their Enemies, for having beyond all expectation received an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, and loſt ſome of our Souldiers, we are extreamly terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by this accident, leſt the</hi> Canaanites <hi>and all the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Land ſhould hear it, and ſhould incompaſs us and cut off our name from the Earth, for we have little hope of any proſperous proceedings, in time to come; But be thou aſſiſtant to us O Lord who art Almighty, and in thy mercy change our preſent ſorrow into joy, our diſcouragement into confidence, and give us Victory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joſhua</hi> having made this Prayer, God preſently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to ariſe and purge the People from that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge and Theft which had been committed among them, by concealing thoſe things which were conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to himſef, aſſuring him that his was the cauſe of their preſent Calamity, which as ſoon as it was diſcovered, <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> ſhould be again victorious over their Adverſaries. <hi>Joſhua</hi> hereupon calling for the High Prieſt and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, he caſt Lots upon the Tribes, and the Lot fell upon the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> he then caſt them again upon Families, and it fell upon the Family of <hi>Zacharias;</hi> Laſtly,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:44689:53"/>the Lots were caſt Man by Man, and it fell upon <hi>Achan,</hi> who unable to deny what was diſcovered by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, confeſſed the fact, and produced what he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, whereupon he was preſently ſtoned to death, and the Anger of the Lord was appeaſed.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Joſhua</hi> having purified the People, led them forth againſt the City of <hi>Ai,</hi> and laying an ambuſh of men ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly over night above the City, early in the morning he drew the Enemy out to fight, who being encouraged by their former ſucceſs, boldly aſſaulted them, but <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſeeming to retreat and flie, drew them farther off the City, imagining that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> fled, and that they ſhould gain a ſecond Victory over them, and thereupon all the Men of <hi>Ai,</hi> and of the next City <hi>Bethel,</hi> were called out to purſue them, ſo that there was not a man left in either City. When <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſuddenly making a ſtand, and giving a ſignal to thoſe in ambuſh, they inſtantly march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the City and ſet it on fire, which when the Men of <hi>Ai</hi> looking back perceived, they preſently fled and ſcattered themſelves through the Fields, but were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued ſo furiouſly that few eſcaped, the King of <hi>Ai</hi> was taken alive and hanged on a Tree by <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and twelve thouſand, even all the Inhabitants of <hi>Ai</hi> were ſlain that day; The ſpoil they got was very conſiderable both in Silver and Cattel, all which <hi>Joſhua</hi> when he came to <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> diſtributed among the Souldiers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Gibionites</hi> who dwelt near <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> having notice what had happened to <hi>Jericho,</hi> and <hi>Ai,</hi> and fearing the ſame misfortune, ſince they underſtood that <hi>Joſhua</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended utterly to root out the <hi>Canaanites</hi> from off the Earth, they reſolved to ſend Ambaſſadors to conclude a Peace with him, and knowing that if they owned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be <hi>Canaanites, Joſhua</hi> would make no League with them; They came to him with proteſtations, that they had no converſe nor alliance with that Nation, but being incited by the fame of his glorious Victories, they were come from a very far Countrey, which he might perceive by their old Shoes and Garments, and by the mouldy Bread, which were all new when they ſet forth
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44689:54"/>on their Journey, but by the length of the way were now in the condition they ſaw them; And that they were aſſured that God had given the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to inherit, with whom they therefore deſired to be confederate; By this ſubtil practice they perſwaded the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to enter into Amity with them, and <hi>Eleazer</hi> the High Prieſt and the Council of Elders ſware to them that they ſhould for the future be their Friends and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and no hoſtility ſhould be offered them. In three days after <hi>Joſhua</hi> incamping on the Borders of their Countrey, underſtood that the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> dwelt not far from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and were <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and ſending for the Chief of them, charged them with this deceitful dealing, who alledged that having no other way to procure their ſafety they were obliged to make uſe of this, whereupon he called to him the High-Prieſt and Elders; and they concluded not to infringe the Outh of God, but however for this treachery they were condemned to be Hewers of Wood, and Drawers of Water to the Camp.</p>
            <p>When the King of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> heard that the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> he aſſembled live Kings his Neighbours, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to fall upon them, who perceiving their danger, deſired <hi>Joſhua</hi> to aſſiſt them, who marching with all ſpeed to their relief, he with his whole Army fell upon them early in the morning, and quickly put them to flight, and purſuing them to a ſteep Tract called <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Then <hi>Joſhua</hi> removed his Camp to <hi>Shiloh,</hi> and ſet up the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle there, and from thence he marched to <hi>Sichem,</hi> and there built an Altar according to the command of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and being now well ſtricken in years, he aſſembled all the People in <hi>Shiloh,</hi> where he repreſented to them the happy ſucceſs wherewith till that time God had favoured them becauſe they had obſerved his Laws, that no leſs than one and thirty Kings who had preſumed to oppoſe them, were by them overcome, and all their Armies diſcomfited in Battel, and moſt of their Cities deſtroyed, ſo that there was no memory of them remaining, he therefore thought fit they ſhould ſend to ſurvey the extent of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and to meaſure it out among the Tribes; which being approved of by the Congregation, ten men were appointed to view the Land, who returning with a full account of it in fix months time, <hi>Joſhua</hi> with the High-Prieſts and Princes of the Tribes divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Countrey amongſt them; and then he diſtributed the prey they had taken from the Enemy, which was very great, ſo that they were all inriched by it.</p>
            <p>After which he aſſembled the whole Army, and to thoſe that were planted on the other ſide <hi>Jordan,</hi> who had born Arms with the reſt, and were in number no leſs than Fifty Thouſand, he ſpake af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner; <hi>Since God the Father and Maſter of our Nation hath given this Countrey into your poſſeſſion, and hath promiſed to preſerve the ſame to your for ever, and ſince ye have cheerfully aſſiſted us in all our neceſſities and dangers, according to Gods command and direction, it is requiſite, now we have no further ſervice for you, that we diſmiſs you home to enjoy what you purchaſed, and may thereby be in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to ingage with us hereafter upon all occaſions.

            <p>Having ſpoke thus, <hi>Joſhua</hi> imbraced the Chief of the Tribes, who returned and their whole peoplewith them; After the Tribe of <hi>Reuben</hi> and <hi>Gad</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Menaſſites</hi> had paſſed over <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> they built an Altar upon the Bank of the River as a Memorial to Poſterity of their Alliance with thoſe on the other ſide; which when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> beyond <hi>Jordan</hi> heard, they raſhly imagined their Brethren deſigned to violate their Religion, and introduce the Worſhip of falſe Gods, and therefore inſtantly Armed themſelves to be revenged on them as having forſaken the Laws and Ordinances of their Fore-Fathers. But <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Eleazer</hi> the High-Prieſt, and the Elders reſtrained them, adviſing firſt to inquire what their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was, and accordingly to proceed againſt them; Whereupon they ſent <hi>Phinehas</hi> the Son of <hi>Eleazer,</hi> and ten of the Princes as Ambaſſadors to them, who when they were arrived, an Aſſembly was ſummoned, and <hi>Phinehas</hi> ſtanding up in the midſt of them, ſpake to this purpoſe.</p>

               <hi>You have committed too heinous an offence to be puniſhed with words, and yet we would not ſuddenly take up Arms againſt you, though the crime you have committed is very heinous, but rather chuſe firſt to admoniſh you; To which purpoſe we are ſent to you as Ambaſſaders, hoping that in confideration of the Friendſhip between us you will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to acknowledge and deteſt your fault; We therefore require you to inform us of the cauſe why you have built an Altar, that if it be with an ill deſign you may not think you are hardly dealt with, if we take revenge upon you for the ſame, but if it be otherwiſe, we may be ſatiſfied upon what account it is erected; For we can ſcarce believe that you who are ſo well grounded in the knowledg of God, and the Laws which he himſelf hath given you, ſhould ſince your departure from us, and arrival in your own Patrimony, which you have obtained by his favour, and peaceably enjoy by his Providence.

            <p>THE Life of <hi>David</hi> is a mixture of Good and Evil, of Joy and Grief, of Contempts and Glories, of Vices and Virtues, of Actions and Paſſions, of unthought of Succeſſes, and of ſtrange Accidents and Marvels; We will conſider him in a twofold ſtate, of a Servant, and of a Maſter, and will obſerve with what Wiſdom he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved himſelf in the one, and with what Majeſty he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himſelf in the other. He comes firſt to Court un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the quality of a Muſician, there he makes himſelf known for a good Souldier, admired as a Commander of an Army, and crowned as a Conqueror. <hi>Saul</hi> was tormented with an Evil Spirit which was maintained by his melancholy humor, and nouriſhed by his paſſion, They ſeek out for him a fair Young man, who withal was ſkilful in playing on the Harp, to make him merry, one of his Servants ſaid, That <hi>David</hi> the Son of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> was fit for that Imployment; He is ſent for in the Kings name, he comes, he pleaſeth while he played on his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, but <hi>Saul</hi> is diſpleaſed when he handleth his Weapons, whoſe envy cauſed his Valour to be reputed a fault.</p>
            <p>This young Shepherd who in his Apprenticeſhip had learned to fight with Lions and Bears, would go to the War as well as his Brethren, who blame his Curioſity, and deſpiſe his Perſon; There muſt be uſually ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Exploit to put a man at firſt in great credit at Court, and the Combate of <hi>Goliah</hi> was that which Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven had prepared to raiſe <hi>David;</hi> One man alone who affrighted the whole Army, nine foot high, and armed with five hundred pound weight of Iron, continues for forty days his proud Bravado's, challenging the ſtouteſt of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to combate. All their hearts were frozen at the ſound of his terrible voice, and none dares come forth againſt him. The King propounds great Riches and his Daughter in marriage to him who would take away this blemiſh from the People of God, printed on the whole face of the Army by this <hi>Philiſtine. David</hi> hereupon preſents himſelf, and gets forth to fight with him, not with the guilded Arms of <hi>Saul,</hi> but only with
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44689:57"/>a Sling; The Giant ſcoffs at him, and finding him ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently armed to defend himſelf from Dogs, but not fit to ſet upon Men, he deſigns <hi>Davids</hi> little body as a fit prey for ſome Bird of rapine. But this Champion of the Lord of Hoſts reads firſt a Leſſon to him of Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhews his ſkill in fighting; <hi>Thou comeſt to me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with a Spear, a Sword, and a Buckler, but I come to thee in the Name of the God of Armies, of the God of the Hoſts of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>at which thou this day haſt ſcoffed with ſo great inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; It is written in Heaven that this great God will deliver thee into mine hands, and that I ſhall take away thine head from off thy ſhoulders, and that I ſhall make a great Feaſt for all the Beaſts of prey with the fleſh of this thy monſtrous Body, whereby thou ſhalt know there is a God in</hi> Iſrael.</p>
            <p>He ſaith it, he doth it, he ſtrikes his Adverſary with a blow of the Sling in the midſt of his Forehead, &amp; makes this mighty Tower of fleſh to fall in a moment, cutting off the head of this terrible Giant with his own Sword, which put the whole Army of the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> to confuſion, and raiſed up the glory of the choſen People to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable height. Yet this is the fountain of all the great Evils that <hi>David</hi> after ſuffered, the Great ones ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire him, the People applaud him, he is the Subject of the Songs of the Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which ſet him above <hi>Saul.</hi> It is this Muſick that enraged <hi>Sauls</hi> evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and would not give him any reſt; <hi>David</hi> muſt be deſtroyed becauſe he ſaved the Nation; He muſt be put to death becauſe he reſtored the people to life; He muſt be diſhonoured for having recovered the honour of the King; He is ſufficiently faulty becauſe he is too virtuous. <hi>Saul</hi> reſolved to be rid of <hi>David,</hi> yet thought it dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to attempt his life openly who was ſo high in the peoples eſteem, and therefore under pretence of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour beſtows on him a chief place in the Army, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Courage would carry him into danger, and ſo his death would be imputed to chance or deſtiny; But when he ſaw he returned from manifeſt perils with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory and the applauſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that he behaved himſelf with great wiſdom, <hi>Saul</hi> ſuſpected him more than
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:44689:57"/>before, and injuriouſly married his Eldeſt Daughter to another; But ſince his honour was ingag'd, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſcandal of faithleſneſs, he offers him his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Daughter <hi>Michael,</hi> but with very harſh and dangerous conditions, no leſs than by the death of two hundred <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> whom he hoped it was hardly poſſible for him to vanquiſh, but herein God who overthrows the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the malicious to eſtabliſh his own Councils upon their ruines, cauſed the Victories and Marriage of <hi>David</hi> to ſucceed to his own content, accompanied with the good will and admiration of all the Court.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jonathan</hi> the Eldeſt Son of <hi>Saul</hi> was ſo aſtoniſhed with his valiant Exploits, his rare Virtues, and incomparable Carriage, that he loved him as his own Heart, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft himſelf of the moſt precious things he had to adorn him withal; <hi>David</hi> likewiſe ſwears unto him reciprocally an Immortal Friendſhip, and their two Souls ſeem'd united together with an indiſſoluble affection. Poor <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> who was of incomparable mildneſs declared to his Father as much as he durſt the innocency of <hi>David,</hi> and the great ſervices he had done to the Crown, aſſuring him there was not a man in the Kingdom of a more harmleſs and pleaſing Converſation, and that it was the joy of his Heart, and his only ſafety to have him always at his ſide; <hi>Saul</hi> ſeem'd to be overcome with theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and ſuffered <hi>David,</hi> whom he had driven far off, to return again near his Perſon, but <hi>Saul</hi> upon a day when <hi>David</hi> play'd on the Harp in his preſence, endeavoured to ſtrike him through with his Lance had not <hi>Davids</hi> nimbleneſs avoided that evil blow, and leſt any ſhould charge him with perfidiouſneſs, he excuſed it by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper of his Spirit; <hi>Jonathan</hi> yet another time endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured his reconciliation, but being repelled by <hi>Saul</hi> with harſh words and threats to kill him, he ſaw clearly there was no more ſafety for his Friend, and perſwaded him to retire; <hi>David</hi> goes from Court, and makes a ſad departure from his beloved <hi>Jonathan,</hi> thouſands of tears and ſighs being vented betwixt them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saul</hi> ſeeing he was eſcaped out of his bloudy hands,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:44689:58"/>ſends Souldiers to bring him back, which <hi>Michal</hi> his Wife having notice of, ſhe tells her Husband, and makes him depart ſuddenly in the deep ſilence of the night, putting in his place an Image in the Bed; Next morning <hi>Sauls</hi> Guards break into the Houſe, and paſſing on to the Bed, there found the counterfeit; <hi>Michal</hi> was accuſed thereof and chidden by <hi>Saul,</hi> but ſhe excuſed her ſelf ſaying, <hi>Her Husband had compelled her to it, threatning to kill her, if ſhe would not obey;</hi> This ſtill increaſed his rage, and cauſed him to invent every day new means to deſtroy him, whom above all men he ought to have preſerved. In the mean time <hi>David</hi> knew not whither to retire himſelf; He would have taken the boldneſs to have gone to <hi>Samuel</hi> who was yet alive, but this would have been prejudicial to both in the mind of <hi>Saul,</hi> who turned all ſuſpitions into fury; He therefore goes to the Town of <hi>Nob</hi> to <hi>Abimelech</hi> the High-Prieſt, who ſeeing him in a very mean Equipage was ſomewhat amazed at his Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val. But <hi>David</hi> to confirm him, ſaid that he came about ſome urgent buſineſs of the Kings, and had not time to provide for his Journey, deſiring the Prieſt to give him ſome Bread and a Sword, who having no other, gave him ſome Loaves of the Conſecrated Shew-Bread, and the Sword of <hi>Goliah</hi> which was kept in the Tabernacle for a Monument.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saul</hi> hearing that <hi>David</hi> was ſeen in the Woods with a Lance in his hand, and accompanied with ſeveral Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Officers, ſharply complained of the unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Servants. Whereupon <hi>Doeg</hi> an <hi>Edomite</hi> of a barbarous behaviour, to get ſavour with his Maſter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed <hi>Abimelech</hi> the Prieſt with all his Company for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing <hi>David</hi> with Weapons and Proviſions, he being preſent at that time; <hi>Saul</hi> inſtantly ſent for him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached him with the fact, he wiſely excuſed it as not knowing but <hi>David</hi> was as much in the Kings favour as ever, and that what he did was for <hi>Sauls</hi> ſervice as he judged This excuſe was very juſt and lawful, but the jealouſie of <hi>Saul</hi> was never ſatisfied, ſo that without any other form of proceeding, he commanded that villanous
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:44689:58"/>Butcher <hi>Doeg,</hi> (all others refuſing to lift up their hands againſt theſe ſacred Perſons) to fall upon the High-Prieſt, and the Prieſts that accompanied him, eighty five in number, who were all murdered in one day, and that curſed Servant exceeding his Commiſſion drove on his Murderers to the Town of <hi>Nob</hi> which they filled with Fire and Bloud.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> having underſtood by <hi>Abiathar</hi> the Son of the High-Prieſt all that was paſt, was pierced with moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grief, accuſing himſelf as the cauſe of the death of theſe unhappy ones, and perceiving well the Spirit of <hi>Saul</hi> was wholly invenomed, he ſaved himſelf in the Cave of <hi>Adullam,</hi> where though he thought himſelf hid from the Eyes of all the World, yet his Father and Brethren flying the Perſecution, found him out, and wounded his tender heart with their Lamentations for the change of his condition, who was now no longer a <hi>David</hi> Triumphant, the object of all thoughts, and the diſcourſe of all Tongues; He comforted them the beſt he could, and recommended them to the protection of the King of <hi>Moab</hi> till he knew what it would pleaſe God to do with him; At this time all the baniſhed that fled for ſafety, and all the miſerable betook themſelves to <hi>David</hi> to the number of four hundred men, who intrenched themſelves in a Fortreſs, going forth every day to ſeek wherewithal to maintain themſelves. In the midſt of all theſe misfortunes the good Prince kept always in his Heart a true love of his Countrey, and knowing that the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> had laid Siege before <hi>Keil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Mean while <hi>David</hi> ran from Deſart to Deſart with his Troops, when he received a ſevere Check from <hi>Nabal</hi> to whom he ſent for relief, and for which he threatened to

Againſt whom are you come forth with ſo great a ſtrength of Arms and Horſes? againſt a poor dead Dog, a miſerable little Beaſt?

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saul</hi> was ſo amazed with this action that he ran to him, and imbracing him weeping, ſaid, <hi>This O</hi> David <hi>is a ſure ſign whereby I know for certain thou ſhall reign after me, ſo great a goodneſs not being able to be rewarded but by an Empire I only beſeech and intreat you to have pity on my poor Children af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my death, and not to revenge upon them the injuries I have offered you;</hi> Hereupon he ſwore to deal peaceably with him for the future; But the Spirit of <hi>Saul</hi> was unequal and oft departed from reaſon for a long ſeaſon; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>David</hi> reſolved to go out of the Kingdom to <hi>Achiſh</hi> King of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> a Sworn Enemy to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſince he could not beſecure any where elſe, yet did he never bear
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:44689:59"/>arms againſt the people of God: At laſt the fatal day of <hi>Saul</hi> drew near, and he ſaw the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> came upon him with their utmoſt ſtrength, and being troubled in mind, in the confuſions of a diſturbed Spirit, he ſought to the Divine Oracles to learn his deſtiny in this preſſing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, but this unhappy Prince ſought after the dead in vain, having trod under feet the admonitions of the Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and therefore he applies himſelf to the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> who by <hi>Samuels</hi> appearance foretold the routing of his Army, his own death, and likewiſe his Childrens ſad Fate, at which he was ſo affrighted that he fell into a Swound. Being recovered, he went to his Army, and the next morning perceived the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> wonderfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and reſolv'd to fight; And his own people ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly weakened, and ſeeming to carry misfortune in their faces; The Enemies gave the onſet with very great violence, and overthrew the foremoſt of the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> wherein <hi>Jonathan</hi> with his two Brethren ſealed the laſt proofs of their valour with their bloud and death in the ſight of their miſerable Father, who ſeeing he could not dye ſo ſoon as he deſired ſuffered himſelf to fail upon his own Sword, vomiting, forth his Soul and bloud with ragings and griefs unſpeakable.</p>
            <p>While this unhappy Battel was fought, <hi>David</hi> was purſuing the <hi>Amalakites,</hi> who in his abſence had ſackt the Town of <hi>Ziglag</hi> the place of his retiring, whom he overtook loaden with their prey, and regained his two Wives <hi>Ahinoam</hi> and <hi>Abigail</hi> whom they had taken away; As he came from this Battle, a young <hi>Amalekite</hi> preſents himſelf, and brings him the news of the death of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and his other Sons, affirming that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had ſtood by at the death of the King, and had help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to die by his own command; Whereat <hi>David</hi> moved with extream grief, tore his garments, wept, faſted, and made a funeral Lamentation over <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan;</hi> Cauſing likewiſe the <hi>Amalekite</hi> to die, who by his own confeſſion was acceſſary to the death of the King; And though <hi>David</hi> at this time might have taken poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſion of the Kingdom, yet upon prudent deliberation he
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:44689:60"/>thought it not convenient to be too haſty; Whereupon <hi>Abner</hi> a chief Captain, without loſing time, ſeeing there yet remained a Son of <hi>Saul</hi> alive named <hi>Iſhboſheth,</hi> aged forty years, though of little courage, and leſs under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, he made him preſently come into the Camp, and cauſed him to be proclaimed the true and lawful Succeſſor of <hi>Saul,</hi> not ſo much for the love he bore him, or the eſteem of his ſufficiency, as intending to reign by him and over him.</p>
            <p>All the People ſwore Allegiance to <hi>Iſhboſheth,</hi> except the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> from whom <hi>David</hi> ſprung, which joyning together in favour of him, crowned him King in <hi>Hebron,</hi> where he reigned ſeven years before he poſſeſt the whole Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Afterward <hi>Abner</hi> laying aſide his war-like humor, fell in love with a Concubine of <hi>Sauls</hi> named <hi>Riſpah,</hi> whereat <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> being offended, <hi>Abner</hi> for one poor word ſpoken in a very mild manner, entred into a rage againſt the King, and ſaid, <hi>It was to uſe him as a Dog to quarrel with him for a woman after ſo great Services as he had done for the Crown, and from whom he held both his Life and Kingdom;</hi> The poor Prince held his peace, and durſt not anſwer a word to this bold Fellow, and was pitifully devoured by his own Servant. <hi>Abner</hi> grew ſo hot with anger that he diſpatcht Meſſengers to <hi>David</hi> to deſire his friendſhip, and promiſeth to bring the whole Kingdom of <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> into his hands. <hi>David</hi> anſwered, That he was willing to make peace with him, if he would cauſe his Wife <hi>Michol</hi> to be reſtored to him, whom they had married to another after his departure, which was readily agreed to, and performed.</p>
            <p>Mean time <hi>Abner</hi> powerfully ſollicites the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to betake themſelves to <hi>David,</hi> ſince God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted their ſafety and reſt into his hands, who would unite all the Tribes under one Monarchy, which would make him a happineſs to his people, helpful to his friends, and terrible to his Enemies. This Diſcourſe prevail'd very much on the Principal ones of the Nation, who ſaw ſmall hopes of <hi>Iſhboſheth,</hi> he being diſparaged both by Nature and Fortune. Soon after <hi>Abner</hi> meets <hi>David</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> was much perplexed hereat, and uttered grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Curſes againſt <hi>Joab</hi> and his whole race, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the blemiſh of this Murder, be aſſiſted at the Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of <hi>Abner,</hi> proteſting againſt the cruelty of thoſe who had taken away his Life, and highly ſetting forth the praiſes of the dead; yet he cauſed not proceſs to be made againſt <hi>Joab,</hi> conceiving that he was not able to deſtroy him in ſuch a time when it was dangerous to provoke him.

And it is certain that of all the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> none equall'd him in all kind of perfections. He was one who feared God without Superſtition; was Religious without Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie; Valiant without Sternneſs, Liberal without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching

He rendred Juſtice exactly to his Subjects, favoured Arts, Inricht and Fortified Towns, Erected Stately Pallaces, and brought the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> out of Servility, who had not yet known what Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence was; He was honoured by the great Ones, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by the Prieſts, admired by the Wiſeſt, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt adored by the People. But as all light in mortal things hath a ſhaddow; God ſuffered him to fall into a great offence which ſerved to humble him, and cauſed very much trouble in his Houſe; His mind being freed from the cares of War and Buſineſs, he deſcried from the top of his Pallace a Woman that bathed her ſelf in her Garden, he inquired her name, her Kindred, and her Quality, and becoming in Love thereby, ſends for her to his houſe, and had Company with her; How dear did this unhappy caſt of his Eye coſt him; When a man once exceeds in this blind Paſſion, he goes further than ever he deſigned.

David</hi> awaking as it were out of a dead ſleep, acknowledged his ſin with a true humility, and ſubmitted himſelf to all the Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments it ſhould pleaſe the great Judge to inflict upon him; He was preſently changed into another man, and was exceeding Penitent, his Heart bleeding and his Eyes weeping continually for his grievous offence, and God beginning the puniſhments of his ſin (which yet he had pardoned as to his own perſon) cauſed the Child Conceived in Adultery to dye.</p>
            <p>A year after thoſe pitiful Tragadies of his Houſe

               <hi>Abſolon</hi> ſaves himſelf in the Houſe of his Grand-Father by the Mother, the King of <hi>Geſhur,</hi> where he remains three years without daring to ſee the King his Father who would no ways pardon this great Crime. <hi>Joab</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to reconcile the Son to the Father by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a diſcreet Woman of <hi>Tekoah,</hi> and at length pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, <hi>Abſolon</hi> returns, the King imbraces him, gives him the kiſs of peace and re-eſtabliſhes him in the Court; The Spirit of this Prince was high and tempeſtuous, and being well made, courteous, liberal, couragious and capable of great undertakings, he entertained ambitious thoughts; He ſaw his Father declining, <hi>Adonijah</hi> his elder Brother too much a fondling, and <hi>Solomon</hi> yet a Child unable to oppoſe him, and therefore conceived the Kingdom could not ſlip out of his hands; And the better to ſecure it he provided himſelf a guard of Souldiers and ceaſed not ſecretly to gain the hearts and good will of all his Fathers Subjects; Never was any Prince more prodigal of his Courteſies, whoever had any buſineſs with the King, he called them to him, imbraced them, kiſſed them, and enquired of their condition and ſuit, and ſaid, <hi>There was no other miſhop but that the King was old and tired with buſineſs, and had not appointed any one to hear the Complaints of his Subjects and do them Juſtice, but if one day he ſhould have that charge due to him by his cirth, he would give full ſatisfaction to every one.</hi>

            <p>The Trumpets ſound, and the Armies approach <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> men having a good Cauſe, ingage like Lions; But the Rebels affrighted with their own guilt, were ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered, and put to flight, ſo that one Party ſeemed to come only to kill, and the other to be ſlain, Twenty thouſand falling dead on the place; <hi>Abſolon</hi> aſtoniſht at this ſudden change of Fortune, gets on his Mule and flies through a Forreſt where his head being caught within the branches of a Tree, his Mule left him hanging be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Heaven and Earth; as a ſpectacle of the Vengeance of God for his ingratitude to ſo good a Father; Of which <hi>Joab</hi> having notice, ſtruck him through with three Darts, though forbidden by <hi>David,</hi> and ten young Souldiers made an end of him, the body, was interred in a Pit under a great heap of Stones, though he had built a ſtately Monument for himſelf which he called <hi>Abſolons Place.</hi> Behold the horrible end of an Evil Son and a Rebellious Subject, ſufficient to deter Poſterity from ſuch wicked practices to the end of the World. While this was doing, <hi>David</hi> incloſed himſelf in a little Town, expecting the Event, and continually inquiring of the health of <hi>Abſolon,</hi> but when certain news came of his death, he was pierced with ſo violent a grief, that he could not be comforted, loſing all Courage, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every moment, <hi>O</hi> Abſolon <hi>my Son</hi> Abſolon, <hi>Oh that this favour had been done for me that I might have died for thee!</hi> Every one caſt down his Eyes for pity, and the whole Victory was turned into ſorrow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joab</hi> always bold and inſolent toward his Maſter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches <hi>David,</hi> thinking thereby to juſtify his own fault,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:44689:64"/>telling him, <hi>That he would put to confuſion all his faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants who had that day ſaved his Life, his Houſe, and Kingdom, that he ſeemed of a very ſtrange nature, to hate thoſe that loved him, and love them that hated him, ſince it was plain that if all his good Captains and Souldiers had periſhed to ſave the life of one Rebellious Son he would have been very well ſatisfied;</hi> Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſwore to him by the Living God, <hi>That if he did not riſe, and entertain thoſe who returned from the Battel, there would not one man remain with him before morning, which would prove a greater diſpleaſure than had ever yet happened to him.</hi> He preſſes him ſo vehemently that the King without daring to anſwer a word roſe up, and did all he required; By degrees his great grief diminiſhed, and the rejoicings of the people who came to carry him back to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in triumph made him forget his loſs, and endeavouring to bring back all to him, he pardoned them with unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meekneſs, being ready to give <hi>Joabs</hi> place to <hi>Amaſa Abſolons</hi> chief Captain; But <hi>Joab</hi> quickly prevented this, by killing with his own hand him who was deſigned his Succeſſor. After this he purſued <hi>Sheba</hi> a Captain of the Rebels who retired into <hi>Adela,</hi> which being beſieged by <hi>Joab,</hi> a Woman of great diſcretion and credit with the people perſwaded them to ſlay him and throw his head over the Wall which put an end to this whole bloudy War.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Davids</hi> re-eſtabliſhment in his Kingdom, he reigned about Eleven years in full peace, and in continual exerciſes of Piety and Juſtice, and aſſembling the States of his Realm, he made his Son <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> whom he had choſen, to be confirmed King in his ſtead; He lived near ſeventy two years, reigned forty, and died a thouſand thirty two years before the Birth of our Saviour, and about three thouſand from the Creation of the World, leaving vaſt Treaſures for building the Temple, as an Eternal, Monument of his Devotion and Underſtanding; It was a ſpecial favour to him that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be born of his Line, and that his Birth was revealed to him ſo long before it was known to the world; He oft ſets it down on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>AFter the death of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, his Army and Dominions were divided between his Captains, among whom <hi>Seleucus</hi> made himſelf King of <hi>Syria,</hi> And afterward <hi>Antiochus Epiphanius</hi> reigned in <hi>Aſia,</hi> who being invited by ſome Apoſtate <hi>Jews</hi> to come to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he incamped before it, and by his Faction within had the gates opened and the City betrayed to him, about the year of the World 3796. and before the Nativity of Chriſt 168. He robbed the Temple, and carried away the Golden Table, Candleſtick and Cenſers, with all the other veſſels dedicated to God, leaving nothing of any value behind him, and raiſing ſuch an horrible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the Heavens ſeemed to weep, and the Earth to bluſh with Bloud; It was a ſport to that barbarous man to prophane Holy things, and a continual exerciſe to flea and roaſt men alive, or to throw them into boiling Caldrons, for no other crime but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the True Religion, as he did by the Seven Sons of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> whoſe courage and conſtancy out-brav'd all his moſt exquiſite Tortures.

            <p>Amidſt theſe deſolations was found a gallant Old man named <hi>Matthias</hi> a Prieſt, the Father of many Sons, all men of valour, who went out of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to retire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the City of <hi>Modin,</hi> where he aſſembled his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, reſolving to oppoſe themſelves againſt the fury of the Tyrant, but was quickly ſummoned to render up himſelf and all his men, and to offer Incenſe to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Idols; But this virtuous man, calling his people to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſpake thus to them; <hi>We ſhould be too much in love with Life, to keep it with the loſs of the True Religion; I am ſorry that ever I was born in ſuch an Age as to have ſeen the diſaſters of my Nation, and the deſolation of the Holy</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <hi>abandoned to the hands of Rapine and to impious propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:44689:76"/>and the moſt cruel Severities of War in recompence of their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed infidelity.</hi> They had no ſooner received this anſwer, but forty other of the Principal <hi>Saxons</hi> arrived, who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to excuſe what had happened over night, laying all the blame on ſome few raſh heady fellows, who knew nothing of the proceedings of the Commanders of the Army, nor of their ſending Ambaſſadors to them.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Arthur</hi> ſuſpecting this to be another ſubtle trick of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> commanded theſe Meſſengers as well as the former to be ſecured in the Marſhals Tent; whilſt he himſelf in the ſecond Watch of the night marched pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately againſt the Enemy, dividing his Army into three parts; and having goue about three miles they fell upon the <hi>Saxons</hi> Out-guards e're they were aware, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſuch a tumult and confuſion amongſt them, one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and crying out upon another, that the moſt valiant among them were diſmayed. <hi>Mordred</hi> deſirous to revenge his laſt overthrow, fell in fiercely among them; But ſome having by this time armed themſelves made reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, defending themſelves amidſt the Carts and Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, and thereby for a while ſtopt the violence of the <hi>Brittains,</hi> others unable to reſiſt, broke out of the Camp and fled, but being purſued by the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Horſe a great number periſht in the next River, chuſing drowning ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to fall into the hands of their mercileſs Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, who that day gave no Quarter. It was thought this Bloudy Battle, and ſo great a ſlaughter of ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of <hi>Saxons</hi> would have utterly diſabled them that they ſhould never after have been troubleſome to the <hi>Brittains. Arthur</hi> having thus vanquiſhed his Enemies, diſmiſt all the Ambaſſadors in his Camp, upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they would return back to <hi>Germany,</hi> but ſuffered the reſt of the meaner <hi>Saxons</hi> to remain ſtill in the Land, provided they would turn Chriſtians, and pay a yearly Tribute. The <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> who had aſſiſted him in this War he treated with much State and Magnificence at <hi>London,</hi> giving them all poſſible reſpect and honour, and diſmiſſing them with rich Preſents and Princely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <pb n="156" facs="tcp:44689:77"/>
            <p>It is written of King <hi>Arthur,</hi> that in one Battle againſt the <hi>Saxons</hi> with his Sword named <hi>Callibourn</hi> he ſlew above eight hundred of them, if it be poſſible to be true. In twelve ſet Battles beſides Skirmiſhes, he is ſaid to have return'd Victor from the ſlaughter of the <hi>Saxons;</hi> The names of which places are ſaid to be. The firſt at the mouth of the River <hi>Gleyn;</hi> The ſecond, third, fourth, and fifth near the River <hi>Douglas</hi> in <hi>Lenox.</hi> The ſixth at the River <hi>Baſſus;</hi> The ſeventh in the Wood <hi>Calidon;</hi> The eight near the Caſtle of <hi>Guinien.</hi> The ninth at <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi> in <hi>Wales;</hi> The tenth by the Sea-ſide in a place called <hi>Rithwood.</hi> The eleventh upon a Hill named <hi>Agued Cather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;</hi> The twelfth at <hi>Bath</hi> or <hi>Bathen</hi> Hill.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe things were acted in <hi>Brittain, Conranus</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi> was Murthered in his Bed-chamber, by the Treaſon of <hi>Donald</hi> Governor of <hi>Athol,</hi> in the twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth year of his Reign and the ſixteenth of <hi>Arthurs</hi> Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over <hi>Brittain;</hi> After whom ſucceeded <hi>Eugenius</hi> his Nephew; About this time ſome Authors aſcribe to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur</hi> the obtaining of many glorious Victories againſt the <hi>Iriſh, Danes, Norwegians</hi> and other <hi>Northern</hi> Nations, yea ſome affirm that he ſubdued moſt part of <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Low Countries, Normandy, France,</hi> the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the people of the Eaſt, the credit whereof ſeems very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Only it is certain (as <hi>Hector Boetius</hi> affirms) that <hi>Arthur</hi> lived in the days of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Emperor, about which time the <hi>Goths, Vandals, Burgonians</hi> and <hi>French</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded and ruin'd divers parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, yet we find no mention of K. <hi>Arthur</hi> acting any thing among them.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding his wonderful Atchievements, it is related <hi>Lucius Hiberus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Legate demanded of him a Tribute for <hi>Brittain,</hi> which he not only denied but alſo threatend to have a Tribute from <hi>Rome,</hi> as appears by his Letters ſent to the Senate to this purpoſe. <hi>

            <p>King <hi>Arthur</hi> to increaſe the Courage of his Soldiers is ſaid to have inſtituted the Order of the Knights of the <hi>Round Table,</hi> to which none were admitted, but ſuch of the Nobility as were moſt renowned for Virtue and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, they were in all the number of one hundred and fifty, the Chiefeſt of them being Sir <hi>Lancelot,</hi> S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r <hi>Triſtram,</hi> Sir <hi>Lamrock,</hi> Sir <hi>Gawin</hi> and others. They were all record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Knights of great Renown, and had not King <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thurs</hi> Valour been moſt tranſcendent each of them might have paſſed for no leſs than a <hi>Worthy.</hi> Theſe things are related of him of which the Reader may credit as much as he pleaſe. To paſs therefore theſe queſtionable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, let us proceed to what is more certain.</p>
            <p>After the <hi>Brittains</hi> were delivered from the terror of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and had for ſome time enjoyed peace and quietneſs, they grew Rich and Wealthy, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to repent of the League they had made with <hi>Loth</hi> King of the <hi>Picts,</hi> whereby it was agreed that <hi>Mordred</hi> his Son ſhould ſucceed, they now reſolving that no For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner ſhould Reign over them, and therefore addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves unanimouſly to King <hi>Arthur,</hi> they hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeech him ſince he had no Sons to nominate a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of their own Nation to govern them after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe; <hi>Arthur</hi> finding it in vain to contradict this their reſolution, ſince they abſolutely refuſed to be ruled by a Stranger, adviſed them to find out one of the Bloud-Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al themſelves, whom for his Wiſdom, Valour, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility they were willing ſhould Reign over them, and he for his part promiſed to ratifie and confirm their Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Nobility and Commons thereupon met together with great joy, and at length agreed upon <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:44689:78"/>Son of <hi>Cador</hi> Duke of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> a virtuous and comely young Gentleman, and induced with all Princely qualities; who being brought by the Peers of the Realm into the Council Chamber and preſented to <hi>Arthur,</hi> he gladly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted their Choice, and forthwith cauſed <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to be Proclaimed Heir Apparent to the Crown by the name of <hi>Prince of Brittain;</hi> who being thus preferr'd, behaved himſelf with that diſcretion and gallantry, that the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> entertained a very high opinion of his worth and future Government.</p>
            <p>Mean time <hi>Loth</hi> King of the <hi>Picts</hi> deo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aſing, <hi>Mordred</hi> his Son ſucceeded him, who hearing that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was proclaimed Prince, was much diſturbed and ſent Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors to <hi>Arthur</hi> to complain that contrary to the honour of a King he by proclaiming <hi>Conſtantine</hi> his Heir had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the League between himſelf and his Father, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to defeat him of his rightful Inheritance; deſiring him not ſo eaſily to conſent to the perſwaſions of the <hi>Brittains,</hi> as thereby to violate the Laws both of God and man, and admoniſhing him yet to obſerve the League which he had ſolemnly ſworn to, and to perſwade his Subjects to do the like, leſt they ſhould provoke the wrath of Almighty God againſt them who is a juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger of the breach of all Oaths, Leagues, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants. To this the Nobles of <hi>Brittain</hi> anſwered, <hi>That the League concluded between</hi> Arthur <hi>and</hi> Loth <hi>endered but for their Lives, and was determined upon the death of either of them, and therefore</hi> Arthur <hi>had done nothing but according to the duty of a Prince who tendred the peace and happineſs of his Subjects in providing one of their own Nation to ſucceed him, thereby to prevent the Realm from falling into the hands of ſtrangers, which they could by no means ſuffer. Therefore if the</hi> Picts <hi>loved their Weal &amp; Security, it would be good for them to be contented with their own Bounds and Dominions, ſince if they ſhould attempt to gain other mens Eſtates and Territories they would be forced in a ſhort time to ſee the miſchievous Conſequences of ſuch ill adviſed under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Ambaſſadors of <hi>Pictland</hi> returning with this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, the whole Nation were ſo ſtirr'd with indignation,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:44689:78"/>that they reſolved immediately to revenge their wrongs by open War; But firſt they endeavoured to procure the <hi>Scots</hi> to aſſiſt them, and ſending Ambaſſadors to <hi>Eugenius</hi> then King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he readily agreed to their requeſts upon pretence that ſome <hi>Scotch</hi> Rebels who fled to <hi>Arthur</hi> were received by him, and likewiſe ſuffered to make In roads into <hi>Scotland. Arthur</hi> having notice of theſe Tranſactions, and War being Proclaimed againſt him, he firſt ſecured the Sea coaſts with conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable forces to prevent the Landing of the <hi>Saxons</hi> if they ſhould attempt it. And then marched with the reſt of his Army as far as the River <hi>Humber,</hi> near the Banks whereof he pitcht his Tents, (a place formerly fatal for the overthrow of the <hi>Brittains</hi>) expecting the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> who in a ſhort time came up to them, and both Armies were in ſight ready to ingage each other, when certain Biſhops of all the three Nations riding to and fro, took great pains to perſwade the Kings to Peace and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, eſpecially ſince what they were going to try with the Sword, and the loſs of much Bloud and many Lives, might as well be compoſed by an Amicable and Friendly Agreement; Neither could they better gratifie the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> the common Enemies to the Chriſtian Religion than by weakning and deſtroying each other to make way for them to Conquer all together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mordred</hi> and <hi>Eugenius</hi> were induced by theſe carneſt exhortations to refer the differences to ſome indifferent Perſons, and preſently to lay down their arms upon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that the League with King <hi>Loth</hi> ſhould be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerved. <hi>Arthur</hi> was alſo content for his part to have agreed thereto, but the other <hi>Brittains,</hi> eſpecially the Kindred and Allies of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> utterly refuſed it, and gave divers reproachful words to the Biſhops for their unſeaſonable interpoſing, ſince they were already ranged in battel, ſo that it might be doubted they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to betray their Army to their Enemies under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of an unprofitable agreement. After this both Parties ingaged with great fury, but the <hi>Brittains</hi> had ſuch diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by the place where they ſtood, which was full of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:44689:79"/>Mire, Bogs, and Moſſes, that they could neither advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagiouſly defend themſelves nor offend their Enemies, yet the Battel continued a long time with the ſlaughter of ſo many men that the river <hi>Humb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r</hi> near which it was fought grew red with bloud, and carried a multitude of dead bodies into the Sea. In the heat of the ſight a ſubtil <hi>Scot</hi> cryed out with a loud voice in the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> tongue, that <hi>Arthur</hi> and moſt of his Nobility were ſlain, and it was therefore in vain to reſiſt any longer or hope for Victory, but better for every man to ſhift for himſelf and endeavour to make his eſcape.</p>
            <p>This news wonderfully incouraged the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> but the <hi>Brittains</hi> were ſo much aſtoniſhed at it that the greateſt partinſtant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, fled away; Others judging it only a crafty device to diſcourage them continued to make the utmoſt reſiſtance, till they were overpowred and almoſt every man ſlain. This Victory was veryhardly got, and coſt more lives than any other for many years before, for of the <hi>Scots and Picts</hi> who won the Feild there were killed above Twenty Thouſand, together with King <hi>Mordred,</hi> and abundance of the Nobility of both Nations; Of the <hi>Brittains</hi> and their confederates in the fight and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit above thirty thouſand fell, and among them King <hi>Arthur</hi> himſelf, and <hi>Gawan</hi> brother to <hi>Mordred</hi> who had ſuch an intire affection for his Lord and Maſter <hi>Arthur,</hi> that he fought couragiouſly on his ſide that day againſt his own brother <hi>Mordred. Gawan</hi> and moſt part of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Nobility were likewiſe ſlain. Next day the Camp was plundred, and among other rich ſpoyls <hi>Guyni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> King <hi>Arthurs</hi> Wife, with a great number of other Ladys and Gentlewomen were taken Priſoners, though ſhe and ſome others were afterward redeemed upon ranſom. This Bloudy Battel was fought in the year of our Lord 542. the 26 year of the reign of King <hi>Arthur,</hi> and ſo much weakned both the <hi>Picts, Scots</hi> and <hi>Brittains,</hi> that they could not recover their loſſes in man, years. The ſame year many ſtrange Prodigies were ſeen. The Graſs and Herbs in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> were ſtained with Bloud; Near <hi>Camelon</hi> a Cow brought forth a Calf with two heads;
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:44689:79"/>and an Ewe brought forth a Lamb of both Sexes; The Sun for ſeveral days appeared like Bloud; The Sky was full of bright Stars at noon divers days together. In <hi>Wales</hi> there was a Battel between the Crows and Magpies on one ſide, and the Ravens on the other, and great ſlaughter was made on each ſide.</p>
            <p>The Body of this famous Worthy was buried at <hi>Glaſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire</hi> in the Church yard, and diſcovered in the reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, who being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a <hi>Welch</hi> Miniſtrel that could ſing many Hiſtorys in <hi>Welch</hi> of the Acts of the ancient <hi>Brittains,</hi> declared that <hi>Arthurs</hi> Body was there buried Sixteen foot deep between two Pillars leſt his Enemies the <hi>Saxons</hi> ſhould have found him, <hi>Henry</hi> cauſed the place to be dug up; After they had digged about ſeven Foot, they found a mighty broad Stone with a leaden Croſs faſtened to that part which lay downward, with this Inſcription. <hi>Hic jacet Sepultus, inclytus Rex Arthurus in Inſulae Avaloniae; Here lieth the renowned King Arthur in the Iſle of</hi> Avalonia; His Body was incloſed in a great Tree made hollow, whith being opened, his Bones appeared of a very great bigneſs, his Shinbone reached above the knee of a very tall man, his ſkull was ſo large that the place between his eyes was a ſpan broad, in which there appeared ſome ſigns of wounds and bruiſes; The Body of his wife <hi>Gynever</hi> was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe buried with him, the Hair of her head was curiouſly plaited and ſhin'd like burniſht Gold, but being toucht inſtantly fell to duſt.

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:44689:91"/>extraordinary Strength ſeem'd a Giant, that defended one of the Towers which were aſſaulted by Count <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond;</hi> he had been often repulſed but ſtill renewed the Attack making terrible havock among the Chriſtians, and intollerably inſulting over thoſe who fell under his Arms, and expoſing himſelf naked to a vaſt number of Arrows that were ſhot at him, he with both his hands fell to throwing down Stones of a prodigious bigneſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe who attempted to undermine the Wall, though he had above twenty Arrows ſticking in his Breaſt, and looked as if he were briſtled with them; <hi>Godfrey</hi> coming from his own Quarter, and unable to endure this inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of a Barbarian, with a well placed Arrow ſhot him through the very Heart, and tumbled him dead into the Ditch; Thus the braveſt man of the <hi>Turks</hi> ſeem'd to ſtay to receive an honourable death from the hand of the gallanteſt of the Chriſtians; Soon after <hi>Solyman</hi> having made another fruitleſs attempt to relieve them, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged delivered up the City by Treaty to the Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>The Princes, not to loſe the ſeaſon of the year, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed immediately from thence toward <hi>Syria</hi> and for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of Forrage they ſeparated into two Bodies, that part under the Earl of <hi>Flanders</hi> and the Duke <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi> taking the left, and <hi>Godfrey</hi> the right hand, but yet without diſtancing the Armies above two miles aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; The Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> had not marched far, when they had notice that <hi>Solyman</hi> with three hundred and ſixty thouſand <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> all Horſe, with an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of <hi>Arabians</hi> intended to ſurprize and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round the Chriſtians the next morning; Who inſtantly ſent to advertiſe Duke <hi>Godfrey</hi> of their danger, who again joining the Army the Princes incouraged their Souldiers telling them, <hi>That they were the ſame Enemies they had oft before vanquiſhed at</hi> Nice, <hi>and that in ſighting valiantly againſt thoſe wicked Inſidels, if they died they might be certain of eternal happineſs;</hi> And then drawing their Swords they cryed out, <hi>It is the will of God,</hi> which words the whole Army repeated with ſuch a terrible Harmony, the Vallies, Rocks, and Mountains ſhook with the dreadful Eccho; and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:44689:92"/>thereupon, preſently engaging, by the Conduct of <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi> and <hi>Reymond</hi> who ran full ſpeed upon the <hi>Turks</hi> with their <hi>European</hi> Lances, which they had neither Shields nor Breaſt-plates to oppoſe, they were overthrown horſe and man, and the <hi>Arabs</hi> not enduring a charge hand to hand, fearing to be ſurrounded, began to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſlight, which cauſed ſuch fear and diſorder in the whole Army, that it put them in a moment to general rout, and the Chriſtians obtained a compleat Victory, with a Prodigious quantity of booty and plunder which they found in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Camp, and then marching for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward toward <hi>Syria</hi> they arrived about <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Piſidia</hi> which ſurrendred to them without reſſiſtance as did moſt of the other Cities in their paſſage.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the Army refreſht themſelves in <hi>Piſidia</hi> after ſuch Toyls and hardſhips, Prince <hi>Godfrey</hi> had like to have been loſt by a ſtrange accident, which however redound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in concluſion much to the honour of this Prince, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing his Reputation, Courage and Nobleneſs which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared even to admiration upon this dangerous occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; For one day entring alone on Horſeback into a Wood, he heard the voice of a man who cryed out for help with all his power, and advancing to the place from whence the noiſe came, he perceived it was a poor Souldier, who coming to cut Wood was running almoſt quite cut of breath round a great Tree to ſave himſelf from the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs Jaws of a monſtrous and furious Bear which was juſt ready to ſeize upon him; <hi>Godfrey</hi> tranſported with Courage and Charity ſpurred on his Horſe with his ſword in his hand toward the cruel Beaſt, who forſaking the Souldier, with inflamed eyes, gaping Jaws, and the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Claws of her two fore Paws, advanced toward him, and raiſing her ſelf upon her hinder feet to throw her ſelf upon the Horſe, ſhe was affrighted with the Sword, and to avoyd the blow fell ſideling, but ſo that Horſe and man fell over her, and ſhe catch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:44689:92"/>hilt in the belly of this monſtrous enemy, when one of his Gentlemen coming in at the noiſe diſpatcht the Beaſt already overthrown with the terrible blow ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; But <hi>Godfrey</hi> in drawing his Sword from between his legs after his fall, having given himſelf a cruel wound in his Thigh, which during the heat of the combate he did not perceive, he had loſt ſo much bloud, that after he began to cool, he ſuddenly ſunk down in a Swoon; This accident though it proved not dangerous, ſpread a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Conſternation through the whole Army as if all had been loſt, ſo much confidence and authority they placed in his Valor and Judgment, eſpecially ſince the laſt bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle where he gained the Chriſtians a glorious Victory out of the hands of the Inſidels, who were juſt ready to ruine them.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtians having conquered <hi>Cilicia</hi> and great part of <hi>Armenia,</hi> they next beſieged the City of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and having lain ſome time before it, two Fleets from <hi>Genoa,</hi> and <hi>Piſa</hi> arrived very fortunately at the Port of St. <hi>Simeon</hi> with all ſorts of Proviſions, which were very wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com after a five months Seige, the news whereof no ſooner arrived at the Camp, but the Souldiers ran thither in Shoals to furniſh themſelves with what they wanted. The <hi>Turks</hi> who continually watched for all advantages laid an Ambuſcade of four thouſand men that ſecretly ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied out of the Town, who meeting with the Souldiers in their return without Order or Arms, but only their Swords and loaden with Proviſions, they fell upon them, and obliged them to fly to the Mountains leaving all their Proviſions, and a thouſand of their Companions dead upon the place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Godfrey</hi> ſoon advertized of this diſaſter, took a ſtrong Party reſolving immediately to charge the <hi>Tarks</hi> whom he doubted not to find in ſufficient diſorder upon Joy of their Victory; The Governor of <hi>Antich</hi> having from one of the Towers of his Caſtle obſerved this motion of the Chriſtians, was in much pain for the ſafe return of his men, and therefore commanded the greateſt part of his Army to ſally out of the City for their relief; <hi>Godfrey</hi>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:44689:93"/>marched on ſlowly, having notice that the Conquerors, having joined the Troops of the Town, drew near loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with their booty, then drawing his Sword and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his men, after he had lookt fiercely toward the Enemy, he cryed, <hi>Follow me it is the will of God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> Ordering them only to uſe their Swords without either Lances or Arrows, ſo that with their Swords drawn and their Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers they made a kind of Penthouſe againſt the Arrows of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who being thereby put out of their uſual way of fighting, the Service of their Bows being taken from them, they preſently recoiled upon their aſſiſtants, and being incumbred with Spoils, the Chriſtians fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the midſt of them, and on all hands made a moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſlaughter of theſe miſerable wretches, ſo that they were totally routed, ſome flying to the mountains, others toward the City, not dreaming that the Gate was ſhut againſt them; <hi>Godfrey</hi> to prevent their return into the Town, flew like lightning among his enemies, there was no blow of his terrible Sword which drew not a dreadful death with it, ſo that he filled all with Horror, Lloud and Terror, which way ſoever he turned himſelf, and the other Princes finding the Enemies ſtopt by <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freys</hi> Squadron, made a moſt woful deſtruction among them, and their lamentable cries at length obliged the Governor to open the Gates, and receive the ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder into <hi>Antioch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One of the Principal <hi>Turks</hi> of a Stature much exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others, tranſported with fury to obſerve that <hi>Godfrey</hi> killed all who came within the reach of his terrible Sword, he ran up to him foaming with rage, and with his broad-Sword diſcharged ſo terrible a blow on the Duke that he ſplit his Shield in two pieces which he had oppoſed to ſecure his head; when <hi>Godfrey</hi> raiſing himſelf upon his Stirrups, gave him ſuch a furious ſtroke, that his Sword falling on his right Shoulder paſſed quite through his Breaſt to his left ſide, and made that half of his body tumble to the ground, while the other remaining in the Saddle was carried by the Horſe quite through the Town, making ſuch a fearful ſpectacle as ſtruck Conſternation
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:44689:93"/>and Horror in all the beholders; Night coming on the Defendants throwing whole ſhowers of Arrows from the Walls, hindred the further purſuit of the Victory; The Chriſtians loſt above a thouſand men, but it is almoſt impoſſible to count the loſs of the <hi>Turks,</hi> which was ſo great that they partly ſtopped the River with their dead Bodies.</p>
            <p>After this great Victory the Beſieged were more cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blocked up, and ſome time after <hi>Antioch</hi> was ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by Stratagem by the Chriſtian Princes; which was followed by another great Victory wherein the Enemy loſt an hundred thouſand Horſe, and an incredible num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Foot. And then the Princes aſſembled to conſult concerning the principal Enterprize, which was that of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> during which <hi>Godfrey,</hi> or <hi>Geoffry de la Tour,</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out upon a party as he frequently did, he heard the terrible roaring of a Lion, who ſeemed rather to cry out for ſome dreadful miſhap befallen him, than in ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Prey to devour it, and without a moments deliberation he broke away from thoſe that would have held him, toward the next Wood, and ran directly to the noiſe, where he ſaw a horrible Serpent of prodigious magnitude, who having wound himſelf about the Legs of a Lion, had prevented him from defending himſelf, and darted many blows at him with his Tongue to kill him with his Poyſon; who thereupon ſtruck the Serpent ſuch a blow with his Sword, that he killed him without hurting the Lion, and after that cut the wreaths of the Serpent wherewith he was intangled; when the poor Lion ſaw himſelf at liberty, he came in the moſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive manner, and with the greateſt ſubmiſſion to render thanks to his deliverer, couching down and licking his Feet, and afterward would never forſake him, but ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him like a faithful Dog without offending any but his Enemies, upon whom by a ſign given he would be ſure to fall, and was always with him in the Combat and Chaſe, and never failed to provide Veniſon for his Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; a marvellous inſtance of natural gratitude, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to Mankind, who oft prove ingrateful to their
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:44689:94"/>Benefactors though indued with all the force of reaſon.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtians now marching with all ſpeed toward <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> took <hi>Rama</hi> in their way and then marching to <hi>Emaus</hi> about two Leagues and an half from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they from thence had a fair proſpect of the lofty Towers of the <hi>Holy City</hi> which filled the hearts of the Princes, Officers, Souldiers, and the whole Troop of Pilgrims with great Joy, and then coming up to it, that they might avoyd a tedious ſeige, like that of <hi>Antioch,</hi> it was reſolved to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the place by main force, though thoſe within were more numerous than the Chriſtian Army who were not above Twenty Thouſand Foot and fifteen Hundred Horſe, the reſt of that vaſt number of three Hundred Thouſand men who came into <hi>Aſia,</hi> being either dead with diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or ſlain in the ſeveral encounters, the Chriſtians therefore coming up cloſe to the Walls, raiſed up their ſcaling Ladders and mounted to the top from whence with mad courage they threw themſelves into the Town, where they deſperately fought hand to hand with the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens,</hi> who were amazed at this more than heroick bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and no doubt if they had had more Ladders <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> had been that day taken, but ſince one Ladder could mount a very few men, a Retreat was ſounded after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt a great many brave Souldiers in that raſh attempt, who yet ſold their Lives ſo dear, that twice as many of the <hi>Saracens</hi> fell with them.</p>
            <p>Duke <hi>Godfrey</hi> concerned at this miſcarriage, reſolved for the future to aſſault the Town with proper Engines of War, which he managed with ſuch extraordinary ſucceſs, that making a great breach in the Walls, he threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the Town with ſuch admirable courage, that the other Princes following him, they in ſhort time all entred and took full poſſeſſion, putting all the Inſidels to the Sword, and killing the very Children in the Arms of their Mothers thereby if it were poſſible to extinguiſh the whole race of Turks. In ſhort a moſt terrible ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance was taken upon them, and the Houſes being plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the whole Army found themſelves inriched beyond imagination; The richeſt Booty was found in the Temple
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:44689:94"/>of <hi>Solomon,</hi> from whence was taken an ineſtimable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Gold, Silver and Jewels, which the Princes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly preſented Duke <hi>Godfrey</hi> as the Perſon to whoſe only courage and conduct it was due;</p>
            <p>Eight days after this happy conqueſt the Princes and Lords aſſembled to re-eſtabliſh the ancient Government of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by giving it a King; Divers were propoſed, and it was offered to <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> Son to <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, but he deſigning to return home as ſoon as poſſible, declined it, telling the Aſſembly, <hi>That it was moſt evident they ought to chuſe that Perſon whoſe Piety, Modeſty, Frudence Juſtice, Valour and Succeſs had appeared in many occaſions; That Perſon whoſe ſtrength of Age, Body, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, Greatneſs and Majeſty, worthy of an Empire, conſpired to rank him among the greateſt Princes that ever were, and My Lords</hi> (ſayd he) <hi>all theſe extraordinary qualities render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo conſpicuous in the Perſon who poſſeſſes them, that it may ſeem unneceſſary to name him, and God himſelf ſeems to have nominated him in giving him theſe ſurpaſſing advantages above the reſt of mankind, whom he hath choſen like a ſecond</hi> David <hi>to be King of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>It is the Illuſtrious</hi> Godfrey <hi>of</hi> Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> whom the Prince had no ſooner named but the whole Aſſembly interrupted him, crying out with the ſame mind and voice, <hi>Godfrey, Godfrey, long live</hi> Godfrey <hi>the moſt puiſſant and pious King of</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem; And notwithſtanding all the reſiſtance of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Prince, he was obliged to conſent to the Election which ſeemed confirmed to him by Divine approbation; And the very ſame day he was conducted to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and there proclaimed King amidſt the acclamations of the whole Army, and all the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians of the Countrey who came flocking in to inhabit the City of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> He was there preſented with a Royal Crown richly adorned with Pearls and precious Stones which he abſolutely refuſed with this Zealous anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Why ſhould I bear the name of a King in a place where my Saviour hath been crowned with reproaches? ſhould I take the Scepter in my hand, where he hath taken the Croſs upon his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers? Should I ſuffer a Crown of Gold upon my head where he
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:44689:95"/>hath received a Crown of Thornes? Sure I ſhould then hold my ſelf for vanquiſhed if ſuch a vanity ſhould be victorious over my heart. It is God that hath inſpired us with theſe deſigns; It is he that hath conducted and crowned us with ſucceſs, I pretend therefore to no other honours, than to lay all honours at the ſeet of the Croſs of Chriſt.</hi> But though he would not take upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the name of King, yet it was conſtantly given him, as all Hiſtorians of that time and Poſterity have ever ſince done to this very day, and certainly never any King bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſerved to wear that glorious Title which he adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſo many Royal Actions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sultan</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> coming too late to relieve <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> advanced now with a formidable Army to beſiege it, againſt whom <hi>Godfrey</hi> and his Souldiers marched with much courage and reſolution, over whom they obtained an intire Victory, with richer pillage than any time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the whole War, the Enemy loſing thirty thouſand upon the place and as many more in the purſuit. After this Battle the Princes and great Lords who followed them believing they had fully accompliſhed their vow of recovering the Holy Land, took their leaves of King <hi>Godfrey</hi> to return to their reſpective Countries, leaving him only three hundred Horſe and about two thouſand Foot, with which few Troops the King to inlarge the Frontiers of his new Kingdom, conquered the places which were yet untaken round about <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> And now after ſo many Toils being fallen ſick he cauſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be removed to the City, where <hi>July</hi> 8. 1100. In the fortieth year of his age, and the firſt of his Reign he rendred his glorious Soul into the hands of his Almighty Redeemer by a moſt Religious death, (his brother <hi>Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> ſucceeding K. of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in his ſtead) He was a Prince in whom all Virtues, Chriſtian, Civil and Military met in the higheſt point of humane perfection without mixture of any default, ſo that it will remain difficult to find ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like him to whom without Flattery the ſame praiſes may be given, and which induced future Ages to beſtow on him the honourable Title of one of <hi>the Worthies of the World.</hi>
